Yes — **Biome is currently one of the best all-in-one formatters and linters** available, and writing an article about it is a _fantastic idea_ for your site.

  

It shows you’re up to date with developer tooling, understand code quality, and care about performance — which impresses both recruiters and other engineers.

### **🧩 Why Biome is considered the new standard**

  

Biome is essentially the **next evolution of Prettier + ESLint + TypeScript tools**, rewritten in **Rust** for speed and modern workflows.

  

It’s been gaining traction rapidly since 2024 because:

- ⚡ It’s **super fast** (20–100× faster than ESLint or Prettier on large projects).
    
- 🧠 It **combines multiple tools** (formatter + linter + TypeScript + JSON + CSS + TOML) into one binary.
    
- 🔧 It’s **zero-config by default**, but customizable via biome.json.
    
- 🧹 It handles **style and logic** in one go — no more juggling Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, etc.
    
- 🔒 It’s **secure**, written in Rust, with no Node-based dependency hell.
    
- 🔄 It works perfectly in **CI/CD pipelines** and modern stacks like **Next.js**, **T3**, and **Vite**.
    

  

Developers are migrating because it simplifies maintenance and removes config conflicts between Prettier and ESLint.
