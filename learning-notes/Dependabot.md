my notes
Dependabot consists of three different features that help you manage your dependencies:

- Dependabot alerts: Inform you about vulnerabilities in the dependencies that you use in your repository.
- Dependabot security updates: Automatically raise pull requests to update the dependencies you use that have known security vulnerabilities.
- Dependabot version updates: Automatically raise pull requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date.
