# README

## What I Learned
A great README balances _clarity, brevity, and persuasion_.
It communicates **what your project does** and **why someone should care**, while making it effortless to install and contribute.
After studying community standards from across GitHub and open source leaders, these principles stand out:

---
### 1. Write the README before the code

**Tom Preston-Werner’s “Readme Driven Development”** (2010)

📖 [https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

> “A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless.

> Write your README first.”

Writing your README _first_ forces you to think through purpose, users, and API design before touching code.

### **2. Keep it Elegant and Minimal**

**Yegor Bugayenko – “Elegant READMEs”**

📖 [https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/elegant-readme.html](https://www.yegor256.com/2019/04/23/elegant-readme.html)

Yegor emphasises:

- Use **no more than five badges per line**
- Keep each section **under 80 characters per line**
- Start with a **logo**, **badges**, and **one concise paragraph**
- Avoid philosophy or essays — stay practical
