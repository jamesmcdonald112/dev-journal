# ISSUE_TEMPLATES

## What I Learned
Using **issue and pull request templates** helps maintain consistency and quality across your project.
- The .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder **must be uppercase and underscored** for GitHub to recognise it.
- Inside it, files like bug_report.md and feature_request.md are written in **lowercase**, following a convention used by most open-source projects.
- The PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file must be placed in the **root of the** **.github** **folder** and is conventionally written in **uppercase**.
    

GitHub automatically parses these files **by their exact names and paths**, so if the naming differs, they may not appear in the **“New Issue”** or **“New Pull Request”** interface.

This structure keeps your repository **organised, contributor-friendly**, and ready for collaboration.

## Why It Matters
Templates give developers a clear structure to follow when creating **feature requests**, **bug reports**, or **pull requests**.
They help ensure that every submission includes the **key details** needed for review, such as steps to reproduce, goals, or testing instructions.

This consistency keeps contributors focused, helps maintainers **quickly understand and prioritise issues**, and creates a shared standard that makes your project easier to maintain and collaborate on.
