Allow templates in settings
Install community plugins:

- Templater: it defines a templating language that lets you insert variables and functions results into your notes. It will also let you execute JavaScript code, manipulating those variables and functions. List what i had to set up for templator here but dont show any files just say what we did.
- adding dataview and advanded tables

Dataview:
```dataview
TABLE summary, status, date
FROM "Case Studies"
WHERE status != "draft"
SORT date DESC
```


adding these too
