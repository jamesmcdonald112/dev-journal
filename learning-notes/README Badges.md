# README Badges

## What I Learned
README badges are small, dynamic icons that instantly communicate the status of key project metrics like **builds**, **tests**, and **linting**.
They make a README look more professional and trustworthy while providing real-time feedback from CI tools such as **GitHub Actions**, **Biome**, or **Vitest**.

## Example / Code Snippet
Add this section near the top of your README.md (just below your project title):
```markdown
# My Project Name

[![CI](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Code Quality](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/biome.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/biome.yml)
[![Commitlint](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/commitlint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/commitlint.yml)
```

Replace:

- `<your-username>` → your GitHub username (e.g. jamesmcdonald112)
- `<your-repo>` → your repository name (e.g. portfolio-nextjs)
  

Optional static badge examples from [shields.io](https://shields.io):
```markdown
![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/<user>/<repo>)
![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-brightgreen)
![Built with](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Next.js-blue)
```

## Why It Matters
Badges provide instant insight into your project’s health:
- **CI** shows if tests are passing.
- **Biome** shows that code is linted and formatted correctly.
- **Commitlint** confirms commit messages follow standards.
- **Coverage or Dependencies** badges show active maintenance.


They also help recruiters, collaborators, and other developers trust that your codebase follows professional development workflows.

## How to Implement
1. **Ensure workflows exist** in .github/workflows/
    (e.g., ci.yml, biome.yml, commitlint.yml)
2. Copy the badge links into your README.md.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
4. Wait for the next workflow run, the badges will automatically update.
5. _(Optional)_ Add branch protection rules so failing badges block merges.
