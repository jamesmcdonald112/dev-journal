- section elements should usually contain a heading. If a section does not have a heading, it is often more appropriate to use a div instead.
    
- A section can contain a header, because header is simply an introductory container. It can include:
    
    - A heading
        
    - A subtitle
        
    - Metadata
        
    - Buttons or actions
        
    - Introductory text
        
    
- Use header inside a section when the section includes:
    
    - A main heading
        
    - Supporting introductory content
        
    - Optional actions (like a button or link)
        
    
- The header groups the introductory content for that section.
    
- If the section contains only a single heading and nothing else introductory, using header is optional.
