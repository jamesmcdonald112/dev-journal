Here’s a full version of your Dev Journal plan written in plain text (no markdown), with every idea included and expanded. After that, I’ll explain how to create the interactive mind map / graph view like Obsidian using React libraries.

DEV JOURNAL PLAN – FULL VERSION

  

Purpose

You are creating a “Developer Knowledge Base” that combines your learning notes, debugging experiences, reflections, ChatGPT conversations, and project ideas. This Dev Journal will be stored on GitHub and displayed dynamically on your portfolio website. It becomes a living case-study archive showing your real problem-solving process — something employers rarely see.

---

1. Structure of the system
    

  

Layer 1 – Obsidian Notes

You keep personal notes in Obsidian. Each note is a self-contained file describing a problem you faced, how you solved it, what you learned, and any related project or idea.

  

Layer 2 – GitHub Storage

You push these notes (in .md or .mdx format) to a GitHub repository. This makes them version-controlled, searchable, and easy to integrate with your site. You can keep the repo public (to showcase learning) or private (if you want to review first).

  

Layer 3 – Portfolio Integration

Your website (built with Next.js and Once UI) will fetch these notes from GitHub or import them locally. Visitors can browse your Dev Journal entries just like blog posts. Each entry reads like a mini case study with consistent formatting.

---

2. Recommended file name
    
    dev-journal.mdx
    

  

You can later split it into one file per topic if you prefer:

2025-10-17-debugging-context.mdx

2025-10-18-database-connection-error.mdx

---

3. Suggested structure for each Dev Journal entry
    

  

Title: Short, descriptive summary of what you solved.

Date: The date you wrote or solved the issue.

Tags: Keywords like “React”, “Spring Boot”, “Docker”, “Debugging”, “AI”.

Status: Resolved, In Progress, or Idea.

  

Sections:

  

Abstract

Brief explanation of what went wrong and what you learned.

  

Problem

Describe the symptoms and what triggered your investigation. Include relevant error messages.

  

Root Cause

Explain the underlying issue you discovered.

  

Fix

Show how you solved it. Include short code examples or steps taken.

  

Lesson Learned

Summarise the takeaway or insight that will help you next time.

  

ChatGPT Insights

Note any help you received, what was explained, or what tools assisted.

  

Questions to Ask Myself

Self-reflective prompts such as:

– How could I detect this earlier next time?

– Should I create an automated test for this?

– Could I generalise this solution into a mini project?

  

Related Project or Idea

Mention where this issue appeared and whether it led to a new project or tool idea.

  

References

Add any helpful articles, documentation links, or Stack Overflow threads.

  

Metrics or Difficulty

Optionally include how long it took, difficulty level, or what skill improved. Example: “1 hour – Medium difficulty – Improved use of IntelliJ debugger.”

---

4. How to manage your notes
    

  

Option A – Manual copy

You copy finished notes from Obsidian into your Next.js project folder (for example, /app/dev-journal/). They will be rendered automatically by your site’s MDX system. This is the simplest method.

  

Option B – Live fetch from GitHub API

You keep all notes in a GitHub repository (like jamesmcdonald/dev-journal) and your site fetches them automatically using GitHub’s REST API or GraphQL API. Example: fetch the raw markdown file and display it using an MDX renderer. This keeps your site always up to date with new notes.

  

Option C – Automated sync

Use an Obsidian Git plugin to push your notes to GitHub whenever you update them. Set up your portfolio with a Vercel cron job or webhook to rebuild when new notes appear. This creates a self-updating learning system.

---

5. Additional sections to enrich each entry
    

  

– Related Docs / References: links to documentation or tutorials that helped.

– Time Spent / Difficulty: helps track progress and pattern of effort.

– Skill Gained: what you specifically improved (e.g., debugging, async logic).

– Takeaway Snippet: one reusable piece of code or command you’ll remember.

– Tags: keywords for later filtering and graph connections.

---

6. Long-term automation flow
    

  

Obsidian → GitHub (via plugin) → Portfolio Site (via API)

Your site periodically fetches new notes, converts them to formatted pages, and rebuilds automatically. You can also generate summaries or statistics such as “total bugs fixed this month”.

---

7. Benefits
    

  

– Shows how you think, not just what you build.

– Highlights continuous learning and problem-solving ability.

– Demonstrates writing clarity and reflection — huge plus in interviews.

– Allows you to revisit and reuse old solutions quickly.

8. Optional naming ideas for the section on your site

9. Mind map / graph options
    

  

You can represent your Dev Journal visually using a React-based graph viewer similar to Obsidian’s graph view. These libraries can render interactive nodes and edges representing your notes, tags, and relationships.

  

Recommended React graph libraries:

  

– React Flow

Excellent for node-based editors, visual workflows, and mind maps. It’s actively maintained and works great with Next.js.

(https://reactflow.dev)

  

– D3.js

Powerful visualization library. More control but requires custom coding for layouts.

  

– Cytoscape.js with React wrapper (react-cytoscapejs)

Ideal for large, dynamic graphs; supports zooming, panning, and styling nodes easily.

  

– Vis Network (vis.js)

Easy to set up for knowledge graphs or linked data visualizations.

  

– Force Graph (react-force-graph)

3D and 2D graph visualizations that look like Obsidian’s network view.

  

Suggested approach:

Start with React Flow or React Force Graph. Each Dev Journal note can become a node, and tags or links between notes become edges. For example, clicking the “React” tag node shows all notes tagged “React”. This can run inside your Next.js site as an interactive knowledge map.

10. Putting it together
    

  

You’ll have:

• A personal Obsidian vault for raw thinking.

• A GitHub repository for version control and public sharing.

• A Dev Journal section on your portfolio powered by MDX and optionally connected to GitHub.

• An optional graph visualization showing relationships between topics.

  

This combination forms a living, evolving representation of your engineering journey — content-rich, technically impressive, and creatively personal.

If you’d like, I can outline the data format and React component structure you’d need to build the graph later (how to represent each note as a node, handle tags as edges, and integrate it with your portfolio site). Would you like me to do that next?
