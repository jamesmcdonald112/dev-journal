projecxts and the details of the proejct should be targeted ot the job


here are some of the examples we talked about

- Engineered a **high-performance full-stack banking platform*** (Spring Boot + React) capable of processing **10,000+ concurrent transactions*** with **zero data loss*** and sub-100 ms API latency, featuring secure account creation, authentication, deposits, and Luhn-validated transfers.
- **Reduced API response time by ~35 %*** through efficient database indexing and REST endpoint optimisation in a modular **Spring Boot MVC*** architecture.
- **Built a responsive React interface*** with controlled forms, real-time transaction updates, and clear error handling, increasing client form submissions by 30%
- **Developed a comprehensive test suite*** (~200 tests) covering service logic, API endpoints, and UI interactions; automated through **GitHub Actions CI*** to detect regressions early — **reducing post-deployment bugs by over 80 %*** and ensuring a consistent 100 % test pass rate.
- **Containerised and deployed*** the stack using **Docker*** with **Supabase (PostgreSQL)*** for persistence, **Render*** for backend hosting, and **Netlify*** for the frontend — enabling continuous delivery with zero manual deployment steps, with easy rollbacks
