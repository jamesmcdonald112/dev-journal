Frontend focus (match their asks)

- React + TypeScript depth; build and refine user-facing flows with strong UI fundamentals.
- Close Figma collaboration: translate tokens, responsive layouts, micro-interactions, and accessibility (WCAG, keyboard, screen readers).
- Product mindset: instrument features, read analytics, iterate quickly; A/B tests; funnel awareness.
- Performance: Web Vitals, Lighthouse, bundle control (code-splitting, tree-shaking), image strategy.
- State/data: API contracts with backend, caching with SWR/RTK Query, optimistic updates, error/empty/loading states.
- Quality: unit/visual tests (Jest/RTL/Playwright/Cypress), type safety, linting, PR hygiene.
- Design systems: component libraries, Storybook, tokens; reusable patterns and refactors to keep codebase clean.
- AI-first workflow: use Cursor/Copilot (or similar) for scaffolding, refactors, debugging, alternatives; pair AI with human review for perf/accessibility.

Backend/edge alignment (to show full-picture thinking)

- API collaboration: schema-first (OpenAPI/GraphQL), mock servers; feedback on payload shape for perf.
- Auth/session handling on the client (tokens, refresh, secure storage), feature flags/experiments.
- Observability: client error reporting (Sentry), logs, and metrics hooks.
- Caching/latency: leverage CDN/edge where applicable, debounce/throttle on chatty endpoints.
- Security awareness: XSS/CSRF basics, input validation expectations, secure fetch patterns.
- Subscription/consumer patterns: paywalls, trials, churn reduction hooks, notifications/streaks for habit-building.

Remote/high-trust ways of working

- Async tools: Notion for specs/docs, Linear for delivery, GitHub for reviews; concise updates and clear PRs.
- Ownership: end-to-end from spec to prod, including instrumentation and follow-up fixes.
- “Vibe coding”: quick spikes with AI, then tighten code with tests, types, and perf checks.

Potential gaps to address proactively

- Call out any health/wellness or consumer subscription experience.
- Mention specific AI tools you use and examples of productivity wins.
- Highlight design system contributions if you have them; if not, note willingness to lead/maintain.
- Provide examples of accessibility and performance guardrails you’ve enforced.
- Include a brief example of owning a feature end-to-end (requirements → build → metrics).
