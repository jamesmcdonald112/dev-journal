```

It tells social platforms:

- Language: English
    
- Region: Ireland

## Image
You need:

- 1200 x 630 px
    
- Landscape
    
- Clear
    
- Not cluttered
    

  

1273 x 600 is not ideal.

  

Ratio should be 1.91:1

  

Use exactly:

1200 x 630

## **Should You Use Homepage Image?**

  

No screenshot.

No plain background.

  

Best practice:

- Clean image
    
- Brand name on it
    
- Subtle background
    
- Professional look
    

  

Think:
