## **For a Solicitor Site**

  

### **Homepage**

  

Best format:

```
Primary Keyword | Brand
```

Example:

```
Solicitors in Kilkenny | Mary Molloy Solicitors
```

Not:

```
Mary Molloy Solicitors | Kilkenny Law Firm
```

Why?

  

Google weights the beginning of the title more.

  

If someone searches:

“solicitor kilkenny”

  

You want:

Solicitors in Kilkenny → first.

```

- Natural sentence
