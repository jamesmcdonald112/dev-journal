# **Where Does Structured Data Go?**

  

Structured data goes in:

  

👉 `<head>` of BaseLayout



### **Why not include lots of schema properties?**

  

Because:

- Google mainly benefits from **accurate, high-signal fields** (name, address, phone, url, opening hours, geo, sameAs).
    
- Adding lots of optional fields increases your chance of **being wrong**, inconsistent, or out of date.
    
- Bad structured data is worse than minimal structured data.
