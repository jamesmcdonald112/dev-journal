- Why does margin: 0 auto work in block layout but not inline layout?
    
- When text-align: center is applied, what is being shifted — an element or a line?
    
- If three inline elements total 300px inside a 1000px container and text-align: center is applied, how much does the row shift?
    
- Why can’t text-align center only one inline element in a row?
    
- What is the difference between “leftover space belongs to the element” and “leftover space belongs to the line”? Explain in one sentence.
    
- If you wanted three inline elements: first left, second center, third right — why can’t inline layout do that? What layout system would you use instead?
