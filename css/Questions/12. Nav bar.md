- Why is a navigation menu semantically expected to be a **list (****ul > li****)** instead of a group of links in divs?
    
- What does a screen reader announce differently when it encounters a **list of links** vs a flat set of anchors?
    
- What breaks (or becomes harder) if you later add **sub-navigation / dropdowns** and your nav is not list-based?
    
- Why is `<nav> + <ul>` considered a **navigation landmark**, but `<div> + <a>` is not?
    
- When would using only `<a>` elements inside a `<nav>` still be acceptable, and why is it the exception?
    
- Why should the clickable navigation target be the `<a>`itself and **not the** **`<li>`**?
    
- What accessibility or keyboard-navigation issues appear if you style `<li>` instead of the `<a>`?
    
- Why is it important that **each nav item is its own list item**, rather than multiple anchors inside one `<li>`?
    
- How does a list-based nav make it easier to support **ARIA roles** like aria-current="page"?
    
- If you had to justify ul > li > a to a backend or non-CSS dev, what **structural guarantee** does that pattern give you long-term?
