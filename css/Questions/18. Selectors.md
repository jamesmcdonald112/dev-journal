- Explain what a compound selector is.
    
    Give one example and explain what must be true for it to match.
    
- Explain what a complex selector is.
    
    Give one example and explain what structural relationship it depends on.
    
- For each of these selectors, explain exactly what it matches and whether it depends on document structure:
    
    - .btn.primary
        
    - .card .title
        
    - .card > .title
        
    - .item + .item
        
    - .item ~ .item
        
    - a.button
        
    - [data-state="open"]
        
    - .btn:hover
        
    
- Why is .card .title more fragile than .btn.primary?
    
- Why is .stack > * + * considered a good use of a complex selector?
    
- If you change this HTML:
    

```
<div class="card">
  <div class="wrapper">
    <h2 class="title">
```

- Which selector breaks?
    
    - .card .title
        
    - .card > .title
        
    

  

Explain why.
