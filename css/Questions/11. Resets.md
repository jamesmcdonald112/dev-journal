1. Should a reset include *, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }? Why?
    
2. Should a reset remove _all_ margins from headings and paragraphs globally? What’s the trade-off?
    
3. Do you reset list styles (ul/ol { list-style: none; }) globally, or do you prefer opt-in (e.g. ul[role="list"])? Why?
    
4. Should a reset set img { max-width: 100%; display: block; }? What problem does that prevent?
    
5. Should a reset set input, button, textarea, select { font: inherit; }? What annoyance does it fix?
    
6. Should a reset set body { line-height: 1.5; } or is that “not reset”? Where does it belong?
    
7. Would you include html { -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%; }? What’s it for?
    
8. Should a reset include reduced-motion overrides (the prefers-reduced-motion block)? Is that “reset” or “a11y utility”?
    
9. Do you include table { border-collapse: collapse; } in a reset in 2026? Why/why not?
