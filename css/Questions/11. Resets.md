- Why should reduced-motion rules live at the **earliest global level** instead of inside components?
    
- What kinds of motion should _not_ be disabled even when prefers-reduced-motion is active?
    
- Why do tables still matter in modern sites, even if you “never design tables”?
    
- What layout or visual bugs appear when border-collapse: collapse is omitted?
