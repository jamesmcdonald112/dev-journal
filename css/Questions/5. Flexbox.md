- What question does flex-basis answer in flexbox?
    
- When is width used in flex sizing, and when is it ignored?
    
- Why does flex-basis: auto respect width?
    
- Why does flex-basis: 0 ignore width?
    
- When does flex-grow run, and what does it add?
    
- When does flex-shrink run, and what does it remove?
    
- Why does flex-shrink never run unless items overflow the container?
- Why does width _appear_ to block shrinking in flex layouts?
    
- What two things together actually cause this illusion?
    
- Why is width not the true blocker?
    
- Why does fixing the problem usually require changing min-width, not width?
- Why does flex-basis: 0; min-width: 0 solve most “flex items won’t size evenly” bugs?
- When a flex container is too small, how does flexbox decide how many pixels each item gives up, and why is shrink based on_ _flex-shrink × flex-basis_ _rather than_ _flex-shrink_ _alone?




### **Flexbox Shrink Calculation – Core Question**

  

You have a flex container that is **500px wide** with two flex items:

- **Item A:** flex: 1 1 300px
    
- **Item B:** flex: 1 2 200px
    

  

1. What is the **total flex-basis**?
    
2. How much **overflow** exists?
    
3. What is the **shrink weight** of each item?
    
4. How much does **each item shrink**?
    
5. What is the **final width** of each item?
