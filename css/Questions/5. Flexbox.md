- What question does flex-basis answer in flexbox?
    
- When is width used in flex sizing, and when is it ignored?
    
- Why does flex-basis: auto respect width?

- What two things together actually cause this illusion?
    
- Why is width not the true blocker?
    
- Why does fixing the problem usually require changing min-width, not width?
- Why does flex-basis: 0; min-width: 0 solve most “flex items won’t size evenly” bugs?
- When a flex container is too small, how does flexbox decide how many pixels each item gives up, and why is shrink based on_ _flex-shrink × flex-basis_ _rather than_ _flex-shrink_ _alone?
- When flex-wrap: wrap is enabled, in what order does the browser decide whether to **wrap an item to the next line** or **shrink items on the current line**, and in which situations does flex-shrink actually apply?
- What does flex-flow control in Flexbox, what are its default values, and when would you prefer using flex-flow instead of flex-direction and flex-wrap separately?




### **Flexbox Shrink Calculation – Core Question**

  

You have a flex container that is **500px wide** with two flex items:

- **Item A:** flex: 1 1 300px
    
- **Item B:** flex: 1 2 200px
    

  

1. What is the **total flex-basis**?
    
2. How much **overflow** exists?
    
3. What is the **shrink weight** of each item?
    
4. How much does **each item shrink**?
    
5. What is the **final width** of each item?
    

  

> Explain your steps using:

>   

> itemShrink = overflow × (itemShrinkWeight / totalShrinkWeight)




## **Calculating** 

## **flex-grow**

##  **(final version to store)**

1. **Get container size** (main axis only)
    
2. **Calculate total base size**
    
    → add up all items’ flex-basis
    
3. **Find free space**
    

```
free space = container size − total base size
```

3.   
    
4. **Add up all** **flex-grow** **values**
    
    → this gives the _growth pool_
    
5. **Distribute free space proportionally**
    

```
item extra = free space × (item grow / total grow)
```

5.   
    
6. **Final size**
    

```
final size = flex-basis + item extra
```

## **Store-for-later question (core check)**

  

**Question:**

You have a flex container that is **1000px wide**.

  

Flex items:

- A: flex: 1 1 200px
    
- B: flex: 3 1 200px
    
- C: flex: 1 1 200px
    

  

**Tasks:**

1. What is the total base size?
    
2. How much free space is available?
    
3. What is the total grow value?
    
4. How much extra space does **each** item receive?
    
5. What is the final width of each item?
   
   
   


### **Flex shorthand question (store this)**

  

**Q:**

You see the following CSS:

```
.item-a { flex: 2 1; }
.item-b { flex: 1 20px; }
```

1. For each item, which values are being set for:
    
    - flex-grow
        
    - flex-shrink
        
    - flex-basis
        
    
2. Why is flex: 1 20px interpreted as **grow + basis**, but there is **no way** to write a shorthand that means _shrink + basis only_?
    
3. What default value is assumed for the missing flex property in each case?
