- Modals
- JS stable hooks like data-open-menu
- document.querySelector("[data-open-menu]") -  why ise query selectore here?
- dialogue and its methods
- React isalnads vs scripts
- Your script must be written to handle “maybe multiple instances” -  this woudl be good to know
- aria-controls must reference an **element id**. That’s the whole point of it. aria-controls="mobile-menu" → looks for id="mobile-menu" in the DOM.
- data-bound is a simple flag on the element to make sure an event listener is only attached once, even if the script runs multiple times.
