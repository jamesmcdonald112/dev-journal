# CSS Tools: Reset CSS

The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. The general reasoning behind this was [discussed in a May 2007 post](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/04/18/reset-reasoning/), if you're interested. Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original "meyerweb reset" found its way into [Blueprint](http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/), among others.

The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for the `body` element, for example. I don't particularly recommend that you just use this in its unaltered state in your own projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline. Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and so on.

In other words, this is a starting point, not a self-contained black box of no-touchiness.

If you want to use my reset styles, then feel free! It's all explicitly in the public domain (I have to formally say that or else people ask me about licensing). You can grab [a copy of the file](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css) to use and tweak as fits you best. If you're more of the copy-and-paste type, or just want an in-page preview of what you'll be getting, here it is.

Below in kevin powells verison i will incoude some noetes that he mentions and you can inlcude them somewhere on the page please

1. Body min-height sett you 100vh so any short pages wont be an issue
2. Img and picture set max width of 100%  and display of block, block hellps woht the spacing issue and max width is a nice step to take as it will make the image shrink as the viewport narrows.
3. To make forms easier to work with as well - font inherit is the best.
4. Removing animations for people who have turnede them off
