Load Only What You Use

- Every font weight and style is a separate file.
    
- More weights = more HTTP requests = slower load.
    
- Only load the weights you actually use.
    
- Only load italic if you use italic.
    
- Avoid loading full font families “just in case.”
    
- Prefer system fonts when possible.
    
- Consider variable fonts only if you truly need multiple weights.
    

  

Performance Risks

- FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text): text hidden while font loads.
    
- FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text): fallback font shows, then swaps.
    

  

Best Practice

- Use font-display: swap;
    
- Keep font files minimal.
    
- Treat fonts like large assets, not decoration.
