## **Tailwind + Composition Primitives (Final Decision)**

  

**Approach:**

I use **Tailwind for most styling**, but I keep a **small, framework-free set of composition primitives** in regular CSS.

  

This follows **CUBE CSS** principles and patterns from **Every Layout**, while still getting Tailwind’s speed and ecosystem.

---

## **Why not do this purely in Tailwind?**

  

Tailwind is excellent for:

- spacing, typography, colours, states
    
- component styling (@layer components)
    
- utilities that apply to _one element_
    

  

But Tailwind is **not ideal for layout relationships**, especially:

- vertical rhythm between arbitrary children
    
- reusable page containers
    
- repeatable inline/stacked groupings
    

  

Trying to express these purely in Tailwind leads to:

- long, noisy class strings
    
- subtle inconsistencies across projects
    
- layout logic scattered through HTML
    

  

For someone maintaining **many sites**, that’s a liability.

## **What stays in regular CSS (Composition)**

  

These are **layout primitives** that repeat everywhere and should stay stable:

- .flow – vertical rhythm between siblings
    
- .wrapper – centred page/container width
    
- .cluster – inline groups that wrap naturally
    
- .stack – vertical groups with consistent spacing
    

  

They:

- describe **structure**, not appearance
    
- work with CSS variables for easy overrides
    
- do not conflict with Tailwind
    
- remain portable if Tailwind is ever removed

## **Composition primitives (composition.css)**

```
/* ======================================
   Composition primitives (layout only)
   ====================================== */

/* Vertical rhythm between siblings */
.flow > * + * {
  margin-block-start: var(--flow-space, 1rem);
}

/* Centered page/container wrapper */
.wrapper {
  margin-inline: auto;
  max-width: 80rem;
  padding-inline: clamp(1rem, 4vw, 2rem);
}

/* Inline group that wraps naturally (menus, tags, buttons) */
.cluster {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  gap: var(--gap, 1rem);
}

/* Vertical grouping with consistent spacing */
.stack {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: var(--gap, 1rem);
}
```

## **How this is used with Tailwind**

  

Tailwind is still used everywhere else:

- typography
    
- colours
    
- spacing utilities
    
- states (hover, focus, disabled)
    
- components (@layer components with @apply)
    

  

**HTML stays clean and readable:**

```
<section class="wrapper flow">
  <div class="cluster">
    <a class="btn-primary">Contact</a>
    <a class="btn-muted">Pricing</a>
  </div>

  <div class="stack">
    <p>Content block one</p>
    <p>Content block two</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Spacing can be overridden **per container** without new classes:

```
<div class="stack" style="--gap: 0.75rem;">
  ...
</div>

<div class="flow" style="--flow-space: 1.5rem;">
  ...
</div>
```

## **Summary (one sentence)**

  

**Tailwind handles styling; composition primitives handle layout structure — because layout is repetitive, relational, and should not be rewritten 100 times.**

If you want, next we can:

- lock this into your Obsidian notes structure, or
    
- move on to **Every Layout** and add the next primitives (Sidebar, Switcher, Center) cleanly.
