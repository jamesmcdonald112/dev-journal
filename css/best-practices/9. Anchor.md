### **Anchor pseudo-classes — practical rules**

- Pseudo-class order matters: **LVFHA**
	- Link, Visited, Focus, Hover, Active.
    
- Do **not** usually style a:link directly
    
    → style `<a>` instead
    
- :visited is usually:
    
    - not styled, or
        
    - styled the same as `<a>`
        
    
- :hover and :focus should usually share styles
    
    → mouse and keyboard users get equal feedback
    
- :active often has its own brief “pressed” style
    

  

### **Tailwind specifics**

- Tailwind already enforces safe pseudo-class ordering
    
- Variant order (hover: vs focus:) is handled for you
    
- The main risk is **conflicting base utilities** declared later

## **One-sentence takeaway (memorise this)**

  

> Remember **LVFHA**, don’t style :link, treat hover and focus the same, and in Tailwind watch for utility conflicts—not pseudo-class order, as Tailwind handles the order for us.
