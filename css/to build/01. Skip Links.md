Purpose:
- Allows keyboard and screen-reader users to bypass repeated navigation
- Jumps focus directly to main content

Rules:
- Must be the first focusable element in `<body>`
- Points to a real landmark (e.g. `<main id="main">`)
- Hidden visually, NOT removed from the accessibility tree
- Becomes visible on :focus only
- Must not affect layout
- Must not be clipped by parent overflow

```css

.skip-link {
  position: absolute;      /* removed from layout */
  top: 0;
  left: 0;

  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 0.75rem 1rem;

  transform: translateY(-200%); /* hide relative to itself */
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;

  z-index: 1000;           /* above header/nav */
}

.skip-link:focus {
  transform: translateY(0); /* reveal when tabbed to */
}
```

**Key concepts to remember**

- position: absolute → no layout impact
    
- % in transform → relative to the element itself
    
- top/left → deterministic anchor point
    
- :focus → keyboard-only reveal
    
- Keep animation fast or instant (this is not decorative UI)
