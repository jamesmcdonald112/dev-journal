- Text pretty - text-pretty is Tailwind’s **text-wrap: pretty;** utility.
	- Improves line breaks for multi-line text (headings/paragraphs)
	- Reduces “ugly” wraps like a single short word on its own last line (widows/orphans)
	- Doesn’t change font size/weight—just wrapping behaviour.
	- Headings, hero subtitles, short paragraphs where wrapping looks awkward.
