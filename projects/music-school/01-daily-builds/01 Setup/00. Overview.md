## STEP 4: Create Your Folder Structure (2 minutes)

In your terminal, run these commands to create all the folders you need:

mkdir -p src/components/ui

mkdir -p src/features

mkdir -p src/layouts

mkdir -p src/assets

mkdir -p src/styles

mkdir -p src/lib

mkdir -p src/content

Now create the initial empty files:

touch src/layouts/Layout.astro

touch src/components/Hero.astro

touch src/content/site-data.ts

touch src/styles/global.css

touch src/lib/types.ts

---

## STEP 5: Create Your Content Data File (5 minutes)

Open the file: src/content/site-data.ts

Put this content in it (replace the Yahoo email with yours):

export const siteData = { business: { name: "Harmony Music Academy", tagline: "Dublin's Premier Music School", location: "Ranelagh, Dublin 6", email: "YOURNAME@yahoo.ie", phone: "+353 1 234 5678" },

hero: { headline: "Learn Music from Dublin's Professional Musicians", subheadline: "Expert piano, guitar, violin, drums, and voice lessons for kids 5-18. All teachers perform professionally.", ctaText: "Book Free Trial Lesson", ctaLink: "#contact" },

stats: { yearsInBusiness: 12, activeStudents: 250, googleRating: 5.0, reviewCount: 87 } } as const;

export type SiteData = typeof siteData;

Make sure to change YOURNAME@yahoo.ie to your actual Yahoo email address.

---

## STEP 6: Create TypeScript Types File (2 minutes)

Open the file: src/lib/types.ts

Put this content in it:

export interface HeroContent { headline: string; subheadline: string; ctaText: string; ctaLink: string; }

export interface TrustStats { yearsInBusiness: number; activeStudents: number; googleRating: number; reviewCount: number; }

---

## STEP 7: Create Your Base Layout (3 minutes)

Open the file: src/layouts/Layout.astro

Put this content in it:

---

interface Props { title: string; description: string; }

## const { title, description } = Astro.props;

<!doctype html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> <meta name="description" content={description} /> <title>{title}</title> <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" /> </head> <body class="antialiased"> <slot /> </body> </html>

---

## STEP 8: Create Your Hero Component (3 minutes)

Open the file: src/components/Hero.astro

Put this content in it:

---

import { siteData } from '../content/site-data';

## const { hero, stats } = siteData;

<section class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-16"> <div class="text-center"> <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-4"> {hero.headline} </h1>

```
<p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
  {hero.subheadline}
</p>

<a 
  href={hero.ctaLink}
  class="inline-block bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white px-8 py-4 rounded-lg text-lg font-semibold transition-colors"
>
  {hero.ctaText}
</a>

<div class="mt-8 text-gray-600">
  ⭐ {stats.activeStudents}+ Students | {stats.yearsInBusiness} Years of Excellence
</div>
```

</div> </section>

---

## STEP 9: Update Your Homepage (3 minutes)

Open the file: src/pages/index.astro

Delete everything in it and replace with this content:

---

import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'; import Hero from '../components/Hero.astro'; import { siteData } from '../content/site-data';

## const { business } = siteData;

<Layout title={`${business.name} | ${business.tagline}`} description="Expert music lessons in Dublin for kids 5-18. Piano, guitar, violin, drums, and voice. Learn from professional musicians."

<main> <Hero /> </main> </Layout>

---

## STEP 10: Test That Everything Works (2 minutes)

In your terminal, run:

npm run dev

Then open your web browser and go to:

http://localhost:4321

You should see your hero section with the headline, subheadline, button, and stats!

---

## STEP 11: Setup GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

First, go to github.com in your browser and create a new repository called:

harmony-music-academy

Don't initialize it with anything (no README, no gitignore, nothing).

Then in your terminal, run these commands:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/harmony-music-academy.git

(Replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

git add .

git commit -m "feat: initial setup with Astro, Tailwind, Biome"

git push -u origin main

---

## STEP 12: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

First, install the Vercel CLI:

npm i -g vercel

Then deploy:

vercel

Follow the prompts. For most questions, just press enter to accept the default.

When it's done, you'll get a URL like:

harmony-music-academy.vercel.app

Open that URL in your browser - your site is live!

---

## STEP 13: Setup VS Code (Optional - 3 minutes)

If you're using VS Code, install these extensions:

1. Astro
2. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
3. Biome

Then create a folder called .vscode in your project root, and inside it create a file called settings.json with this content:

{ "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome", "editor.formatOnSave": true, "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "quickfix.biome": "explicit", "source.organizeImports.biome": "explicit" } }

This will auto-format your code when you save.

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST

Go through this list and check off each one:

- [ ] Project created with Astro
- [ ] Tailwind CSS installed and working
- [ ] Biome installed
- [ ] All folders created (components, layouts, content, etc.)
- [ ] site-data.ts created with your email
- [ ] types.ts created
- [ ] Layout.astro created
- [ ] Hero.astro created
- [ ] index.astro updated
- [ ] Dev server runs (npm run dev)
- [ ] You can see the hero section at localhost:4321
- [ ] Text shows: headline, subheadline, button, stats
- [ ] GitHub repository created
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel
- [ ] Live site accessible at vercel.app URL

---

## YOUR FOLDER STRUCTURE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

harmony-music-academy/ ├── src/ │ ├── components/ │ │ ├── ui/ │ │ └── Hero.astro │ ├── content/ │ │ └── site-data.ts │ ├── features/ │ ├── layouts/ │ │ └── Layout.astro │ ├── lib/ │ │ └── types.ts │ ├── pages/ │ │ └── index.astro │ ├── styles/ │ │ └── global.css │ └── assets/ ├── public/ ├── biome.json ├── package.json ├── astro.config.mjs ├── tailwind.config.mjs └── tsconfig.json

---

## WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED

You now have:

✅ A working Astro project with TypeScript ✅ Tailwind CSS for styling ✅ Biome for linting and formatting ✅ Proper folder structure (Bulletproof React adapted) ✅ Separated content from components ✅ Type-safe data ✅ A basic hero section ✅ Git repository with semantic commits ✅ Live deployment on Vercel

---

## NEXT STEPS

Once you've completed all the steps above and checked everything off, reply with:

"Setup complete ✅ - I can see the hero section"

OR if you're stuck somewhere:

"Stuck at step NUMBER - here's the error: [paste error]"

Then we'll move on to building the REAL hero section with:

- Images
- Better responsive design
- Proper styling
- Accessibility features
- Performance optimization

Take your time with the setup. Get it right. This is your foundation.
