# **Step 1 — Create your Astro project**

  

Run this in your terminal to start with vitest:

```shell
npm create astro@latest -- --template with-vitest
```

or without: 

```bash
npm create astro@latest harmony-music-academy
```


When prompted, choose:

- **Template:** Minimal (empty)
    
- **Install dependencies:** Yes
    
- **Initialize git:** Yes
    

  

Astro will automatically:

  

### **✔ Create your project folder**

```
harmony-music-academy/
```

### **✔ Install Astro + required dependencies**

  

### **✔ Initialise a new Git repository**

  

You will see a “Liftoff confirmed” message once setup is done.

# **Step 2 — Move into your project folder**

  

After Astro finishes, run:

```bash
cd harmony-music-academy
```

You must be inside this folder for all future commands.

To preview your new site, run:

```bash
npm run dev

Astro will serve your project at:

```
