### **Zoho Mail + DNS + Security — clean notes (copy/paste)**

  

## **1) Goal and separation of responsibilities**

  

**Zoho Mail = human inbox email on your domain.**

- Primary mailbox: **james@musicschoolsites.com**
    
- Aliases (same inbox): **info@musicschoolsites.com**, **sales@musicschoolsites.com**
    

  

**Zoho is NOT for website automation** (forms, PDFs/info-pack delivery, confirmations).

That will be **Resend later**.

  

Rule:

- **Zoho Mail** = humans reading/sending
    
- **Resend** = automated website emails
    

---

## **2) Plan chosen and why**

  

**Zoho Mail Lite (€0.90 / user / month)**

  

Why this plan:

- Cheap + reliable custom-domain email
    
- Supports aliases
    
- No suite bloat you don’t need yet
    

  

Why not Google Workspace (yet):

- More expensive
    
- You don’t need Drive/Docs/team tools right now
    

---

## **3) Licensing model (important)**

  

You bought **1 user** = **1 mailbox** (**james@musicschoolsites.com**).

Then you added **aliases** (**info@**, **sales@**) to that same mailbox.

Aliases do **not** require extra user licenses.

---

## **4) DNS changes in SiteGround (what we actually did)**

  

Domain stayed registered at **SiteGround**. We only edited DNS there.

  

### **4.1 Verify domain ownership (Zoho)**

  

Added a TXT record at the root:

- **Type:** TXT
    
- **Host/Name:** @ (root)
    
- **Value:** zoho-verification=... (your Zoho-provided string)
    

  

Verified successfully in Zoho.

  

### **4.2 Route incoming email to Zoho (MX)**

  

Replaced old MX records with Zoho MX:

- mx.zoho.eu (priority 10)
    
- mx2.zoho.eu (priority 20)
    
- mx3.zoho.eu (priority 50)
    

  

### **4.3 SPF (sender authorization)**

  

Zoho detected an existing SPF, so we **merged** Zoho into it (correct: **only one SPF record**).

- Result: one SPF TXT record that includes Zoho + the previous include.
    

  

### **4.4 DKIM (signature)**

  

Added Zoho DKIM TXT record:

- **Host/Name:** zmail._domainkey
    
- **Value:** v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=... (Zoho-provided key)
    

  

We left the older SiteGround DKIM selector in place (doesn’t break anything).

  

### **4.5 DMARC (monitoring)**

  

Kept DMARC in monitoring mode:

- v=DMARC1; p=none; aspf=r; adkim=r;
    

  

Reason: don’t enforce until you’re sure all senders (Zoho now, Resend later) are correctly authenticated.

---

## **5) Zoho setup inside the admin panel**

- Created primary mailbox: **james@musicschoolsites.com**
    
- Added aliases to that mailbox:
    
    - **info@musicschoolsites.com**
        
    - **sales@musicschoolsites.com**
        
    
- Skipped (not needed):
    
    - Email forwarding
        
    - Delegation
        
    - Data migration
        
    

---

## **6) Testing checklist (do this in order)**

  

**Note:** right after MX/DNS changes, replies can fail briefly due to DNS/mail routing cache. New messages often work first.

1. **Gmail (personal) → Zoho**
    

  

- Send a **new email** to james@musicschoolsites.com
    
- Confirm it arrives in Zoho inbox
    

  

2. **Zoho → Gmail**
    

  

- Send a new email from Zoho to your Gmail
    
- Confirm it arrives
    

  

3. **Gmail → Zoho (reply test)**
    

  

- Reply to the Zoho → Gmail thread
    
- If you get 550 No mailbox…, wait and retry later (propagation/caching)
    

  

If #1 and #2 work but #3 fails:

- Usually temporary propagation/caching, not a broken setup.

## **7) Security settings we configured in Zoho (inbound protection)**

  

### **7.1 Display Name Spoofing (enabled)**

  

**Action:** Move to **Quarantine**

  

Configured valid display-name + sender-address combos:

- **Music School Sites** → info@, sales@
    
- **James McDonald** → james@
    

  

**What it does:**

If an incoming email uses one of your trusted display names but comes from an unapproved address, Zoho treats it as suspicious and quarantines it (so it doesn’t land in inbox).

  

### **7.2 Cousin / look-alike domains (enabled)**

  

**Action:** Move to **Quarantine**

We enabled the feature and will add look-alike domains manually (Zoho doesn’t auto-discover them).

  

**What it does:**

Quarantines emails coming from domains that look similar to yours (typos, swapped letters, similar TLDs), which are commonly used to impersonate you.

  

### **7.3 SPF / DKIM / DMARC verification (inbound)**

  

Picked conservative settings to avoid losing legit mail while still isolating suspicious mail:

- **SPF failure:** Quarantine
    
- **SPF soft-fail:** Quarantine
    
- **DKIM failure:** Quarantine
    
- **DMARC failure:** Quarantine
    

  

### **7.4 DNSBL verification (blocklist)**

- **DNSBL failure:** Temporary Reject
    

  

Reason: most DNSBL hits are junk; temporary reject reduces spam without permanently blocking in case of a false positive.

  

### **7.5 DMARC reporting (not enabled)**

  

We did **not** enable rua/ruf reporting yet (no report mailbox needed right now).

Reason: it generates lots of XML/report noise you won’t read.

---

## **8) DMARC policy decision (why we stayed at p=none)**

- We did **not** switch DMARC DNS policy to p=quarantine yet.
    
- We kept p=none to avoid breaking deliverability while the domain setup is new and while future senders (e.g., Resend) may be added.
    
- Instead, we used Zoho’s inbound verification actions (quarantine) to protect your mailbox immediately.
    

  

Upgrade path later (when stable):

- p=none → p=quarantine → p=reject
    

---

## **9) Group privileges (set for solo operation)**

  

**What groups are:** shared inbox/list addresses (e.g., support@) for multiple users.

  

Recommended settings for you right now:

- **Organization group creation:** ON, **Super Admin only**
    
- **Personal group creation:** OFF
    
- **Personal groups with external users:** OFF
    

  

Reason: prevents accidental group setups/data leakage. You don’t need groups yet.

## **Fix: Gmail replies were quarantined / not showing in Zoho**

  

### **Symptom**

- Zoho → Gmail worked.
    
- Gmail → Zoho reply didn’t show up in Inbox.
    
- It was landing in **Quarantine** due to Zoho anti-spoofing rules.
    

  

### **Cause**

- Zoho **Display Name Spoofing / Display Name Verification** was set to **Move to quarantine**.
    
- Gmail replies used the display name **“James McDonald”**, but Zoho only trusted that display name when it came from approved addresses on your domain.
    
- Result: legit Gmail reply got treated as suspicious and quarantined.
    

  

### **Fix we applied (Option A)**

1. Open **Zoho Mail Admin Console**
    
2. Go to **Security & Compliance** → **Anti-Spoofing** → **Display Name Spoofing / Display Name Verification**
    
3. Edit display name **“James McDonald”**
    
4. Add your personal sender as an allowed address:
    
    - jamesmcdonaldmusic112@gmail.com
        
    
5. Keep action as **Move to quarantine** (still protects you from other spoof attempts)
    
6. Save
    

  

### **Test (confirm it’s fixed)**

1. Send a new email **Gmail → james@musicschoolsites.com**
    
2. Confirm it lands in **Inbox** (not Quarantine)
    
3. Reply **Zoho → Gmail**
    
4. Reply back **Gmail → Zoho**
    
5. Confirm reply lands in Inbox
    


Add this to your notes (copy/paste). It’s written so it works for **you now** and as a **client SOP later**.

## **Zoho security hardening (done)**

  

### **What we configured**

- ✅ **Recovery email(s)** added (multiple personal emails)
    
- ✅ **2FA/MFA enabled** for Zoho admin + mailbox
    

  

### **Why it matters**

- Prevents lockouts (lost password / device / SIM issues)
    
- Reduces risk of account takeover (email is the keys-to-the-kingdom)
    
- This is **mandatory** before scaling to clients or staff
    

  

### **Where it lives (so I can find it again)**

- Zoho **Accounts / Security** (recovery + MFA)
    
- Save **backup codes** in password manager
    

  

### **Recommended standard (for clients)**

  

**Minimum**

- Recovery email + phone set
    
- MFA enabled for all admin accounts
    
- Only 1–2 people are Super Admins (ideally 1)
    

  

**Optional upgrades**

- Org-wide MFA enforcement (when they have staff)
    
- Suspicious login alerts enabled
    
- Dedicated shared “admin” recovery mailbox if they have IT support
    

  

### **Operational rule**

- “Email + domain access must have MFA enabled before go-live.”
