## **Spam Protection**

- **Keep honeypot** (already done) + ensure website always normalizes to "" in schema
    
- **Add rate limiting (server-side)**
    
    - Per-IP limit (e.g. 5/min + 50/day)
        
    - Decide counter storage (depends on hosting: KV/Redis/in-memory)
        
    
- **Add minimum submit time**
    
    - Add hidden timestamp field
        
    - Server rejects “too fast” submissions
        
    
- **Optional spam heuristics (only if needed)**
    
    - Link-count limit in message
        
    - Repeated characters / obvious spam patterns
