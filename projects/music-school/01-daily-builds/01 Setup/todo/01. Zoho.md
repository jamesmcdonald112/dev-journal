### **DMARC: why you don’t start at** 

### **p=reject**

###  **on day 1**

  

DMARC is a **policy** that tells Gmail/Outlook what to do **if an email claiming to be from your domain fails SPF/DKIM alignment**.

- **p=none** = monitor only (don’t block anything)
    
- **p=quarantine** = failing mail goes to spam
    
- **p=reject** = failing mail gets blocked
    

  

You _can_ jump straight to reject, but it’s risky because you might accidentally block **legitimate** mail you didn’t realize you send from somewhere else.

  

Common “oops” scenarios:

- You send from **Zoho**, but also from **SiteGround**, or later **Resend**, or a CRM.
    
- Forwarding breaks alignment.
    
- A device/app uses a different SMTP than you think.
    
- You forget an address like sales@ sending via a different path.
    

  

**So the safe standard is:**

1. p=none while you confirm _all_ your sending sources are correct
    
2. p=quarantine once stable
    
3. p=reject when you’re confident nothing legit will fail

### **DMARC “reporting” (**

### **rua**

### **) is NOT “spam emails sent to you”**

  

It’s not Zoho “identifying spam and emailing you”.

  

DMARC reporting means: **Gmail/Outlook send you aggregate reports** about messages they saw claiming to be from your domain:

- who sent them (IP/provider)
    
- whether SPF/DKIM passed
    
- volumes, failures, etc.
    

  

Why not enable it immediately:

- Reports can be **noisy** and hard to read raw (XML).
    
- You typically use a DMARC reporting service to parse it.
    
- It’s extra admin work with little benefit early on.
    

  

Yes, you _could_ create dmarc@musicschoolsites.com as an alias in 10 seconds — that’s not the hard part. The hard part is **doing something useful with the reports**.

  

**Practical approach for you right now:**

- Leave p=none for a bit, get stable sending/receiving.
    
- Move to p=quarantine.
    
- Add rua only if you actually plan to review reports (or use a tool).

## **Zoho “Security & Compliance” list — what’s worth doing now**

  

You asked: do these one at a time + should this be a TODO for other businesses?

  

Yes: **this is your client playbook**, but you don’t need to turn every dial for every client. You want a **default baseline** that’s strong and low-maintenance.

  

### **Do now (high value, low risk)**

1. **Organization-wide TFA (2FA)** ✅
    
2. **Suspicious Login Alerts** ✅
    
3. **SPF Verification** ✅ (in Zoho admin, not DNS)
    
4. **DKIM Verification** ✅
    
5. **DMARC Verification** ✅
    
6. **DNSBL Verification** ✅ (easy “block known bad senders” layer)
    

  

### **Do soon (still good, but not urgent)**

7. **Cousin Domain Verification** (anti look-alike domains)
    
8. **Display Name Verification** (helps stop “CEO fraud” style display name tricks)
    

  

### **Do later / ignore for now (overkill for you)**

- **S/MIME** (only if you need encrypted/signature email for compliance/legal)
    
- **Group Privilege Settings** (only if you use groups/shared mailboxes)
    
- Trusted domains/senders (usually leave alone; don’t whitelist broadly)

# **Your Zoho TODO list (copy/paste)**

  

## **Zoho — must do now**

- Enable **Organization-wide 2FA** (Zoho Accounts → Security)
    
- Enable **Suspicious login alerts**
    
- In Zoho Admin: turn on **SPF verification**, **DKIM verification**, **DMARC verification**, **DNSBL verification**
    
- Test mail flow end-to-end:
    
    - Gmail → james@musicschoolsites.com (arrives)
        
    - Reply from Zoho → Gmail (arrives)
        
    - Send from Zoho “From” = info@ → Gmail (arrives)
        
    - Reply Gmail → info@ (arrives)
        
    - Repeat for sales@
        
    

  

## **Zoho — do soon**

- Enable **Cousin domain verification**
    
- Enable **Display name verification**
    
- Decide DMARC policy timeline:
    
    - Keep p=none for initial stability window
        
    - Move to p=quarantine
        
    - Later: move to p=reject
        
    

  

## **DNS cleanup — later (optional)**

- After 7+ days of stable email + website, remove legacy SiteGround host records **if not used**:
    
    - autodiscover A
        
    - autoconfig A
        
    - mail A
        
    - ftp A
        
    - ssh A
        
    

  

## **DNS decision — SiteGround DKIM legacy**

- Decide whether to keep/remove:
    
    - default._domainkey.musicschoolsites.com (CNAME → dnssmarthost)
        
    - Keep it **until you are 100% sure** nothing sends mail via that old SiteGround/dnssmarthost path
        
    

---

## **Should you remove those legacy SiteGround records now?**

  

**No.** Not while you’re still testing and while propagation is fresh.

  

Do it later because:

- Removing them now can create new unknowns (especially mail. / autodiscover).
    
- Leaving them doesn’t break your Vercel + Zoho setup.
    

  

When to remove: **after everything is stable** and you’re sure you’re not using SiteGround services.

---

## **What to do about** 

## **default._domainkey...dnssmarthost.net**

  

Given your current SPF is **merged** and still includes the dnssmarthost include:

  

include:musicschoolsites.com.spf.auto.dnssmarthost.net

  

That strongly suggests SiteGround still has mail infrastructure configured.

  

**So your move is:**

- **Leave that DKIM CNAME in place for now.**
    
- Later, if you decide “Zoho is the only sender ever,” then you:
    
    1. remove that SPF include,
        
    2. remove the old DKIM CNAME,
        
    3. keep only Zoho SPF + Zoho DKIM.

If you want to do this cleanly, next step is: tell me where you’re actually sending mail from (Zoho only, or SiteGround might still send anything). Then I’ll tell you exactly what can be deleted safely and what must stay.
