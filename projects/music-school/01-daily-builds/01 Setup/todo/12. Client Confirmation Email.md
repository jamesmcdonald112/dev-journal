**Status:** ⏸ Deferred

**Priority:** Low (nice-to-have)

**Reason:** Internal lead delivery is already working and safe

  

### **What it is**

  

Send a simple confirmation email to the **client** after form submission:

  

> “Thanks for contacting `<Firm Name>`. We’ve received your message and will be in touch.”

  

### **Why it’s deferred**

- Not required for lead capture
    
- Not required for security
    
- Not required for MVP
    
- Adds polish, not functionality
    

  

### **Planned implementation (later)**

- Use **Resend**
    
- Second resend.emails.send() call
    
- to: input.email
    
- Static content (no user input echoed back)
    
- Optional Resend template (not required)
    

  

### **Explicit non-goals**

- ❌ No complex templates
    
- ❌ No tracking / analytics
    
- ❌ No auth or tokens
    
- ❌ No retries or queues
