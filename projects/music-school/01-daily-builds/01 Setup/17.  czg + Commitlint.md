Here’s what to change your notes to (clean, accurate, and matches what you actually installed).

---

## **Links**

- Commitlint docs: https://commitlint.js.org/guides/getting-started.html
    
- czg (cz-git) CLI docs: https://cz-git.qbb.sh/cli/
    
- czg repo (source of truth): https://github.com/Zhengqbbb/cz-git
    

  

Remove the duplicate Commitlint link.

---

## **1) Install Commitlint (validate commit messages)**

  

Commitlint enforces Conventional Commits.

```
npm install -D @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

Create commitlint.config.mjs:

```
export default {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
};
```

---

## **2) Install czg (interactive commit writer)**

  

czg generates Conventional Commit messages without adapters.

```
npm install -D czg
```

✅ You **do not need**:

- commitizen
    
- cz-conventional-changelog
    

  

(Those are what pulled in the old glob@7 + inflight deprecation warnings.)

---

## **3) Add commit script**

  

In package.json:

```
"scripts": {
  "commit": "czg"
}
```

That’s enough to use it.

---

## **4) How to commit (actual workflow)**

```
git add .
npm run commit
```

If czg says **“No files added to staging”**, it’s doing its job — you forgot git add.

---

## **5) OPTIONAL but recommended: enforce commitlint with Husky**

  

This is what makes it impossible to bypass the rules.

  

### **A) Create the hook**

```
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx --no -- commitlint --edit \$1"
```

### **B) Make sure Husky is enabled**

  

You already have:

- "prepare": "husky" in scripts
    

  

So you’re good.

---

## **6) czg config (only if you want scopes / rules)**

  

By default, czg works with zero config.

  

If you want scopes, add a config file. Easiest:

  

Create .czrc in project root:

```
{
  "scopes": ["tooling", "pages", "api", "components", "sentry"]
}
```

(You can go deeper later; don’t over-engineer this now.)
