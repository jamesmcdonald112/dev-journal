## **1. Install Husky**

  

Installed as a dev dependency:

```
npm install --save-dev husky
```

Added Husky auto-install via prepare script (in package.json):

```
"prepare": "husky"
```

Then ran:

```
npm run prepare
```

This created the .husky/ folder.

---

## **2. Hooks I Added**

  

### **🔹 commit-msg hook**

  

Runs commitlint every time I create a commit.

  

File created:

```
.husky/commit-msg
```

Contents:

```
npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1
```

**Purpose:** Blocks commits that don’t follow Conventional Commits.

---

### **🔹 pre-commit hook**

  

Runs formatting and tests **before** each commit.

  

File created:

```
.husky/pre-commit
```

Contents:

```
npm run biome:staged
npm test
```

**Purpose:**

- Formats/lints staged files only
    
- Runs the test suite
    
- Prevents committing broken code
    

  

_(Note:_ _biome:staged_ _uses Biome to format/lint staged files — configured separately.)_

---

### **🔹 pre-push hook**

  

Runs tests **before pushing** to GitHub.

  

File created:

```
.husky/pre-push
```

Contents:

```
npm test
```

**Purpose:** Prevents pushing failing tests to main.

---

## **3. Why these hooks exist**

|**Hook**|**Runs when**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**commit-msg**|When writing a commit message|Enforces commit format (Conventional Commits)|
|**pre-commit**|Before commit is created|Prevents unformatted/linted or failing code from being committed|
|**pre-push**|Before git push|Ensures the main branch never receives broken tests|

---

## **4. Commands I ran to create the hooks**

  

### **Commit-msg:**

```
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg "npx --no -- commitlint --edit \$1"
```

### **Pre-commit:**

```
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run biome:staged && npm test"
```

### **Pre-push:**

```
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm test"
```

Husky created each file and added the correct shebang line automatically.
