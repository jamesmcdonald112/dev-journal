### **What it is**

  

A **service** is a plain function that performs the “business action” for a feature and coordinates side effects.

  

For Info Pack, the business action is:

  

**“Deliver an info pack submission.”**

---

### **Why we created it**

- Keeps the Astro Action **thin** (validation + branching only).
    
- Central place to put **side-effects** (Resend email, Google Sheets storage, logging).
    
- Easier to test (mock the service and assert “called vs not called”).
    
- Easier to extend later (add Sheets without bloating the action).

### **Location**

```
src/features/InfoPack/service/deliverInfoPack.ts
```

---

### **Role in the flow**

```
Form submit → Astro Action (sendInfoPackHandler) → deliverInfoPack → external APIs
```

---

### **What it should contain**

- Calls to external integrations (email, storage)
    
- Any orchestration logic (“do A then B”)
    

  

It should **not**:

- Render UI
    
- Validate inputs (schema already did that)
    
- Handle HTTP concepts (request/response objects)

### **Stub example**

```
export async function deliverInfoPack(input: {
  fullName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  studentAge?: number;
  message?: string;
}): Promise<void> {
  // TODO: send email (Resend)
  // TODO: store submission (Google Sheets)
  void input;
}
```
