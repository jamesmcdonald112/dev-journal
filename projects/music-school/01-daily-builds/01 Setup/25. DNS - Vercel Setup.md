## **Step 1 — Domain registrar stays where it is**

  

**Rule:**

👉 Wherever the domain is registered (SiteGround, GoDaddy, Blacknight, etc.), **leave it there**.

  

You do **not** need to move domains to Vercel.

  

For clients:

- Either **you log in for them**
    
- Or **they log in** and add the DNS records you ask for
    

  

Both are normal.

  

What matters is:

- You can edit **DNS records**
    
- Not where the domain was bought
    

---

## **Step 2 — Add domains in Vercel (this is the source of truth)**

  

In **Vercel → Project → Settings → Domains**, you add:

  

### **Always add BOTH:**

- musicschoolsites.com (root)
    
- www.musicschoolsites.com (subdomain)
    

  

Vercel then tells you **exactly** what DNS records are required.

  

You do this **once per project**.

---

## **Step 2.1 — Decide which domain is canonical (important)**

  

You must pick **ONE** canonical domain.

  

There are only two sane options:

  

### **Option A (recommended):** 

### **www**

###  **is canonical**

- www.musicschoolsites.com = main site
    
- musicschoolsites.com → redirects to www
    

  

### **Option B: root is canonical**

- musicschoolsites.com = main site
    
- www.musicschoolsites.com → redirects to root
    

  

👉 **Pick ONE. Never both.**

---

## **Your current setup (what you showed)**

  

You currently have:

  

### **Root domain**

```
musicschoolsites.com
Redirect → www.musicschoolsites.com
```

### **WWW domain**

```
www.musicschoolsites.com
No redirect
```

✅ This is **correct**

✅ www is your canonical domain

✅ Root redirects to www

  

**Keep this exactly as-is.**

---

## **Step 2.2 — What about the Vercel** 

## **.vercel.app**

##  **domain?**

  

You will always see something like:

```
harmony-music-academy-nu.vercel.app
Valid Configuration
```

### **Do you keep it?**

  

✅ Yes

  

### **Do you redirect it?**

  

❌ No

  

### **Do users see it?**

  

❌ No (unless they know it)

  

This is:

- Vercel’s internal fallback
    
- Useful for testing
    
- Harmless in production
    

  

**Leave it alone.**

---

## **Step 3 — Apply DNS records at the registrar (SiteGround)**

  

This is where most confusion happens.

  

You **do not invent records**.

You **copy exactly what Vercel shows you**.

---

## **Step 3.1 — Root domain (A record)**

  

Vercel gives you something like:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 216.198.79.1
```

At SiteGround:

  

### **Delete the OLD record (important)**

```
A
musicschoolsites.com
35.214.201.242   ❌ (old hosting)
```

### **Add the Vercel record**

```
A
musicschoolsites.com
216.198.79.1     ✅
TTL: 24 hours
```

---

## **Step 3.2 — WWW subdomain (CNAME)**

  

Vercel gives you:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: 82b337ac343471a7.vercel-dns-017.com
```

At SiteGround:

  

### **Delete the old WWW A record**

```
A
www.musicschoolsites.com
35.214.201.242   ❌
```

### **Add the new CNAME**

```
CNAME
www.musicschoolsites.com
82b337ac343471a7.vercel-dns-017.com
TTL: 24 hours
```

---

## **Step 3.3 — Records you do NOT touch**

  

These stay untouched unless you are changing email providers:

- MX (email routing)
    
- SPF
    
- DKIM
    
- DMARC
    

  

Why:

- Website traffic ≠ email traffic
    
- DNS lets you split responsibility cleanly
    

---

## **Step 4 — Wait for DNS propagation**

- Usually: **5–30 minutes**
    
- Worst case: **up to 24 hours**
    
- TTL = how long other servers cache old info
    

  

You left TTL at **24 hours**, which is fine for production.

---

## **Step 5 — Verify in Vercel**

  

In Vercel:

- musicschoolsites.com → **Valid configuration**
    
- www.musicschoolsites.com → **Valid configuration**
    

  

In browser:

- Root redirects to www
    
- Site loads correctly
    

---

## **Key clarifications (important)**

  

### **Why does root use A and WWW use CNAME?**

- Root **must** use A (DNS limitation)
    
- Subdomains **should** use CNAME
    
- This is normal, not special to Vercel
    

---

### **Why delete instead of “adjust” records?**

  

Because:

- You can’t have **A + CNAME** for the same name
    
- Old records conflict with new ones
    
- DNS must be unambiguous
    

---

### **Does Vercel only show these once?**

- Vercel shows them **until DNS is correct**
    
- You can always re-check them later
    
- They are not “one-time secrets”
    

---

## **Final mental model (this is the key)**

- **Registrar** = owns the name
    
- **DNS** = traffic controller
    
- **Vercel** = website host
    
- **Email provider** = mail host
    

  

You are simply telling DNS:

  

> “Website traffic goes to Vercel.

> Email traffic stays where it is.”

---

## **What this unlocks next**

  

Now that DNS is correct, you can safely:

- Add **Resend**
    
- Verify sending domains
    
- Automate PDFs + emails
    
- Clone this setup for every client
