Copy must be:

- Clear
    
- Reassuring
    
- Benefit-first
    
- Short & direct
    
- Focused on parent concerns
    
- Free of jargon
    

  

Emphasise outcomes:

- Confidence
    
- Joy
    
- Progress
    
- Structure
    
- Safety
    

  

Use microcopy for reassurance:

- “Takes less than 3 minutes”
    
- “No obligation — just info”
    
- “We’ll help you choose the right class”
    

  

Formula:

**Feature → Benefit → Parent Outcome**
