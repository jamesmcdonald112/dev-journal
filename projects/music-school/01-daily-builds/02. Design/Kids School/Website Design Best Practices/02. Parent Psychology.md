Parents evaluate based on:

- **Safety** → background checks, small groups, structured environment
    
- **Trust** → teacher qualifications, real photos, testimonials
    
- **Clarity** → lessons, age groups, pricing, timetable
    
- **Convenience** → fast enrolment, mobile-friendly, easy to read
    
- **Progress** → confidence, skill development, exam prep
    
- **Low-commitment options** → Info Pack PDF before committing
    
- **Transparency** → honest pricing and clear expectations
    

  

Everything must signal:

**“Your child will be safe, happy, and improving.”**
