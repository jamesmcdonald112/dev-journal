Create a simple, secondary call-to-action section for parents who are ready to speak directly. 
Include a short headline reassuring parents that they can contact the school anytime with questions about lessons or availability. 
Add a single CTA button: “Contact Us” linking to the Contact page. 
Keep this section minimal, warm, and parent-friendly, with no competing elements or visuals. 
Make it easy to scan and mobile-first.
