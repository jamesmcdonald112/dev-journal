Create a parent-friendly features list introducing the four age groups: Ages 4–6, Ages 7–10, Ages 11–13, and Ages 14–18. For each age group, include a short, simple description of what children learn at that stage, focusing on confidence, fun, and structured progress. Keep all descriptions clear, warm, and benefit-driven. This section should help parents quickly identify the right option for their child.
