Create a short “About the School” section that introduces the mission, teaching approach, and trust credentials in a warm, parent-friendly tone. Include 2–3 sentences explaining the school’s focus on safety, confidence, creativity, and structured progress for children ages 4–18. Add one real classroom or teacher photo for authenticity. Keep the content brief, clear, and reassuring.
