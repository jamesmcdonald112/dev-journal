Create a testimonial section with real parent quotes focused on trust and child progress. Include short quotes mentioning specific outcomes such as increased confidence, enjoyment, and improvement, and reference teacher names and child ages where possible. Use authentic, warm language and keep the layout simple, clean, and easy to scan. Avoid generic or overly long testimonials.
