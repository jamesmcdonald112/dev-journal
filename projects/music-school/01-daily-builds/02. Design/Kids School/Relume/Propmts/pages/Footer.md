Create a clean, simple footer for a children’s music school. 
Include the school name, address, phone number, and email in a clear, scannable layout. 
Add quick navigation links: Home, Lessons, Teachers, Timetable, Pricing, About, Contact, Policies, Events.
Include social media icons if available.
Add a small reassurance line such as “We’re here to help with any questions.”
Keep design minimal, warm, and mobile-first.
