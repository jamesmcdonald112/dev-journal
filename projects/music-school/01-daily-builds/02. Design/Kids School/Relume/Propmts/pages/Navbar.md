Create a clean, simple navbar for a children’s music school website. 
Include the school logo/name on the left and clear navigation links on the right: 
Home, Lessons, Teachers, Timetable, Pricing, About, Contact.
Include a small secondary CTA button: “Download Info Pack”.
Navbar must be mobile-friendly with a hamburger menu for small screens.
Design should feel warm, professional, and parent-focused.
