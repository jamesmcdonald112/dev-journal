Create a warm, professional hero section for a children’s music school (ages 4–18).
Use a real photo of children in lessons, not stock imagery.
Include a clear, parent-focused headline about safety, fun, and structured musical progress.
Short subheadline explaining that lessons are taught by qualified, child-friendly teachers in a safe and encouraging environment.

Primary CTA: Download the Lesson Info Pack (main funnel).
Secondary CTA: none in this section.

Keep layout simple, clean, and mobile-friendly.
