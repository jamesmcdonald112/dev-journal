Create a prominent “Download the Lesson Info Pack” form section. 
Include a short headline and one-sentence reassurance explaining that the Info Pack contains pricing, timetable, lesson options, and teacher information. 
Form fields: parent name, email, child’s age. 
Include microcopy: “Takes 30 seconds — we’ll guide you to the right lesson.” 
Layout should be simple, warm, and highly visible, with a clear primary CTA button. 
Keep the design mobile-friendly and distraction-free.
