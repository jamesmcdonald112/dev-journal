Create a high-impact “Download the Lesson Info Pack” form placed immediately under the hero/trust badges.

This version should feel like a continuation of the hero section — bold, welcoming, and highly conversion-focused.

  

Include a short, warm headline such as:

**“Get the Lesson Info Pack”**

  

Add a brief reassurance line tailored to first-time visitors, e.g.:

**“Everything parents need — pricing, timetable, lesson options, and how to get started.”**

  

Form fields:

• Parent name

• Parent email

• Child’s age

  

Microcopy under the button:

**“Fast & friendly — we’ll help you choose the right lesson.”**

  

Make this version visually stronger than the global form:

- Slightly larger headline
    
- More prominent CTA button
    
- Tighter spacing
    
- Designed to sit comfortably directly after the hero
    
- No heavy borders or distractions
    

  

Mobile-first, clean, and reassuring.
