### **Company Description**

  

We are building a high-converting website for a children’s music school (ages 4–18). The site should help parents understand lessons, pricing, teachers, and timetable quickly. Tone should be warm, professional, and reassuring. The design must feel parent-friendly and focused on safety, trust, and clarity.
