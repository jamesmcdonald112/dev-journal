## **⚠️ Sentry Setup Is Optional**

  

If you copy this project as a template, you must **configure your own Sentry project**.

DSNs and auth tokens **must not** be reused across multiple projects.

---

## **🔧 1. Create a Sentry Project**

  

Go to: https://sentry.io → Create New Project → JavaScript → Astro.

  

Copy the DSN provided during setup.

---

## **📁 2. Replace DSN Values**

  

Update both files:

  

### **sentry.client.config.js**

  

### **sentry.server.config.js**

  

Replace:

```
dsn: "<YOUR_DSN_HERE>"
```

with the DSN from your new Sentry project.

---

## **🔑 3. Add Environment Variable (For Production Builds)**

  

Set the following environment variable **on your hosting provider** (Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare):

```
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<your token>
```

This token:

- **must NOT be committed to GitHub**
    
- **must NOT be added to the repo**
    
- is only used by the hosting platform during the build step
    
    (to upload source maps + create releases)
    

  

You can generate a new auth token here:

  

**Settings → Developer Settings → Auth Tokens**

  

Recommended scopes:

- project:write
    
- project:read
    
- org:read
    

---

## **🏗️ 4. Build Notes**

  

In development:

- You don’t need a release
    
- You don’t need source maps
    
- You don’t need the auth token
    
- The warning
    

```
No auth token provided. Will not upload source maps. 
```

- is normal in dev
    

  

Your errors still appear in Sentry during development.

---

## **🚀 5. Deployment Notes**

  

When deploying:

1. Host pulls your GitHub repo
    
2. Host runs:
    

```
npm install
npm run build
```

2.   
    
3. Sentry automatically:
    
    - uploads source maps
        
    - creates a release
        
    - associates errors with versions
        
    

  

Only if SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is set in hosting environment variables.

  

You **do not** commit dist/.

Hosting providers generate it during the build.

---

## **🐛 6. Testing Sentry**

  

Add this anywhere during development:

```
<button id="error-button">Throw test error</button>
<script>
  document.querySelector("#error-button")
    .addEventListener("click", () => {
      throw new Error("This is a test error");
    });
</script>
```

Then check your Sentry dashboard → Issues → All Environments.

---

## **🧹 8. Files to Update in Each New Project**

  

If copying the template:

- Replace DSN in sentry.client.config.js
    
- Replace DSN in sentry.server.config.js
    
- Add SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN in hosting environment
    
- Ensure astro.config.mjs has correct project + org slugs
    
- Test Sentry with a fake error
