Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. Let me give you a concise summary and answer your questions:

  What You've Completed

  You've successfully finished Phase 0 - Part 1 of your project:

  ✅ Fully Completed:
  - Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui initialization
  - MongoDB connection
  - Product schema and Zod validation
  - API route for product creation (POST /api/products)
  - Admin product creation form with full validation and submission logic
  - Form uses React Hook Form with proper error handling and toast notifications

  Is the Latest Issue Done?

  Yes, the admin product creation feature is DONE. ✅

  All backend and frontend tasks from that issue are complete:
  - ✅ Mongoose Product schema created
  - ✅ POST /api/products route working
  - ✅ Zod validation implemented
  - ✅ Admin form with all fields (title, description, price, specs, reviews, images)
  - ✅ Automatic slug generation
  - ✅ Form submission working with success/error handling

  What You Should Focus On Next

  Based on Phase 0 requirements, you're missing:

  1. /products page (product grid) - Display all products from MongoDB
  2. /products/[slug] page (product details) - Individual product pages
  3. Home page - Currently has generic Next.js template

  These are the immediate next steps for Phase 0. Once those are done, you can move to Phase 1 which covers:
  - Shopping cart functionality (/cart)
  - Search with semantic embeddings (/catalog)
  - RAG/Chat widget on product pages

  Would you like me to help you build the product listing page and product detail page next? These are foundational for the rest of the project.
