Here is the blunt, practical truth with zero waffle: **YES — every single step you described is fully automatable.** Not “theoretically,” not “with hacks.” It is absolutely doable with n8n + a few services + OpenAI.

## ✅ 1. Search Google for “Solicitor in Carlow” → **AUTOMATABLE**

You can automate pulling:

- business names  
- URLs  
- emails  
- phone numbers  
- categories  

**Tools:**  
Google Places API, SerpAPI, Outscraper, PhantomBuster

You’ll get:

- business name  
- website URL

**Yes — fully automatable.**

## ✅ 2. Visit each website and detect if it’s WordPress → **AUTOMATABLE**

Automate by:

- making HTTP requests  
- checking for `/wp-content/`  
- scanning HTML for `wp-` patterns  
- looking for common headers  

Fast and fully automatable.

## ✅ 3. Run Lighthouse automatically → **AUTOMATABLE**

Use:

- Google PageSpeed Insights API  
- Lighthouse CI  
- third-party page speed APIs  

You get:

- mobile/desktop scores  
- performance  
- accessibility  
- security/SEO checks  
- screenshots via API  

Identical to running Lighthouse manually.

## ✅ 4. Generate a screenshot of the homepage → **AUTOMATABLE**

Screenshot APIs:

- URLBox  
- ScreenshotAPI  
- Browserless  
- Puppeteer-as-a-service  
- *Even Google PageSpeed API returns a screenshot for free*

Call:

Store in:

Fully automatable.

## ✅ 5. Generate a personalized email using OpenAI → **AUTOMATABLE**

Feed OpenAI:

- business name  
- URL  
- Lighthouse scores  
- screenshot link/path  
- industry  
- your pitch template  
- extracted flaws/opportunities  

AI outputs:

- personalized paragraph  
- one unique insight  
- complete outreach email  

Fully automatable.

## ⚠️ 6. Insert an image *directly* into the email?  
**Yes — but with deliverability tradeoffs.**

You *can*:

- embed an inline image  
- host image on a CDN and insert it  
- attach the screenshot  

However:

- inline images increase spam risk  
- attachments reduce deliverability  

Best practice: **include a link to the screenshot** for cold outreach.

Technically still automatable.

## ✅ 7. Automatically send the email → **AUTOMATABLE**

Tools:

- Instantly.ai  
- Smartlead  
- Lemlist  
- Mailshake  
- n8n SMTP nodes  

You can send:

- 50–200 emails/day per domain  
- with rotating domains  
- with warm-up  
- with automated follow-ups  

Completely automatable.

---

## ✅ 8. Your role becomes:

- review the generated email  
- approve/tweak  
- send  
- reply manually  

This is normal founder-led prospecting.

# 🎯 SO IS THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW AUTOMATABLE?

The system can:

- scrape businesses  
- extract website data
