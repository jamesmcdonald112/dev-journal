You _can_ do two pages (buying + selling). But don’t do it by default.

  

## **The reality**

- **SEO:** One strong “Buying & Selling Property” page usually beats two thin pages. Two pages only work if each is genuinely deep and different.
    
- **Ads:** You can still run separate ad groups and send both to one page (or to separate sections via anchors).
    

  

## **Decision rule (use this)**

  

### **Do** 

### **ONE page**

###  **if:**

- you’re not writing 1,000–1,500+ words of _unique_ useful content for each
    
- you’re not sure the solicitor will commit time to review two separate pages
    
- you want the reusable template to stay simple
    

  

### **Do** 

### **TWO pages**

###  **if:**

- you’ll write distinct sections + FAQs + process steps for each
    
- you want separate landing pages for ads (better message match)
    

  

Given you’re building a **reusable template** and you’re early: **start with ONE page** and design it so it can split later.

# **Core site structure (based on what you chose: property lead-gen but balanced)**

  

### **Primary pages**

- / (or your current /test as homepage) — positioning + lead capture
    
- /buying-selling-property — money page
    
- /wills-probate — money page
    
- /family-law — supporting service page (later if needed)
    

  

### **Trust + conversion**

- /contact
    
- /about (even minimal)
    
- testimonials section (homepage)
    

  

### **Legal (already done)**

- /privacy
    
- /cookie-policy
    
- /disclaimer
    
- /complaints
    
- /terms (optional)
    
- /accessibility
    

  

That’s the “minimum professional solicitor site” that converts.

# **Your keyword findings: what they actually mean (how to use them)**

  

## **What to target on-page (SEO)**

  

Only use **local + service** terms in headings:

- **property solicitor kilkenny** (Vol 10–100, High)
    
- **buying a house solicitor** (Vol 100–1K, High)
    
- **house purchase solicitor** (Vol 100–1K, High)
    
- **selling a house solicitor** (Vol 10–100, High)
    
- mention **conveyancing solicitor** once early (Vol 100–1K, Medium)
    

  

## **What to use as FAQ targets (SEO)**

  

These are gold because they’re high volume:

- **solicitor costs for buying a house** (100–1K)
    
- **solicitor fee for buying a house** (100–1K)
    
- **probate costs ireland** (100–1K)
    
- **probate fees ireland** (100–1K)
    
- **how much does probate cost** (10–100)
    

  

You do **not** need to publish specific numbers. You answer with:

- what costs depend on (property price, complexity, lender, etc.)
    
- what’s typically included
    
- promise: “we’ll confirm fees after a quick call”
    

  

## **What to use for Ads (not SEO copy)**

  

Near-me terms + broad terms:

- “property solicitors near me”
    
- “conveyancing solicitors near me”
    
    These don’t belong in your H1s. They belong in ad groups.
    

  

## **What to set as negatives (ads)**

  

Competitor names you saw: harte, smithwick, bass, boland, etc.

# **SERP reverse engineering: your conclusions are correct**

  

Your core insight is right: **Kilkenny SERPs are weak and generic**. They hide behind “full service” and don’t hammer intent keywords. That’s an opening.

  

But don’t over-interpret “no one has exact-match title” as “easy win”.

Google still cares about:

- depth of content
    
- authority signals (reviews, local signals, GBP, citations)
    
- UX + speed + internal links
    

  

So we win by being **clear + structured + locally grounded**.

---

# **What you look up for “top 5 organic results + page titles”**

  

You capture **two things**:

1. **SERP title** (what shows on Google)
    
2. **On-page H1** (the main heading on the page)
    

  

They are often different. We care about both.

---

# **Now answer your first question directly**

  

### **Should you do buying and selling as separate pages?**

  

**Start as one page.** Build it so it can split later.

  

Structure it like this:

- H1: **Buying & Selling Property in Kilkenny**
    
- Two big sections:
    
    - **Buying a property** (steps + FAQs)
        
    - **Selling a property** (steps + FAQs)
        
    

  

If later you run ads heavily, you can split into:

- /buying-a-house-kilkenny
    
- /selling-a-house-kilkenny
    

---

# **Your next step (no fluff)**

  

Do this next:

1. Create /buying-selling-property page with the full structure (headings + sections + FAQ placeholders).
    
2. Create /wills-probate page with the full structure (headings + sections + FAQ placeholders).
    
3. Put strong internal links from homepage → these two.
    

  

If you paste your current **homepage sections** (or /test content), I’ll tell you exactly what to move, delete, and rewrite to align with the keyword strategy without making it look spammy.
