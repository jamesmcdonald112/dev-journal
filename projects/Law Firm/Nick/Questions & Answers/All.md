# **📞 CALL STRUCTURE (Clean & Professional)**

  

## **1️⃣ Scope Confirmation (Foundation)**

  

“Before we talk price, I just want to confirm scope so I price it properly.”

- We’re looking at:
    
    - Home
        
    - 4–8 service pages (Property first, then Probate, Family, etc.)
        
    - About
        
    - Contact
        
    - Legal pages (Privacy, Cookies, Disclaimer, Terms, Accessibility, Complaints)
        
    

  

Questions:

1. Do you want all main services live at launch, or launch with Property first and phase the rest?
    
2. Do you expect regular content updates, or mostly static?
    
3. Will you want ongoing SEO work after launch, or just the initial structure?
    
4. Are ads something you see using this year, or not right now?
    

---

## **2️⃣ Positioning (Very Important)**

1. Do you want to be positioned mainly as property-focused, or as a full general practice?
    
2. Is residential property your biggest revenue area?
    
3. Do you want commercial conveyancing mentioned, or mostly residential?
    
4. Are you comfortable targeting “Property Solicitor Kilkenny” directly?
    
5. Within property, are buyers your biggest market, or sellers?
    
6. Who is your ideal client? (first-time buyers, couples upgrading, investors, developers?)
    

---

## **3️⃣ Trust & Compliance**

1. Can we mention years in practice?
    
2. Can we use testimonials?
    
3. Can we embed Google reviews?
    
4. Are you comfortable with wording like “experienced property solicitors”?
    
5. Are there any specific Law Society advertising rules you’re aware of that we need to follow?
    

  

(You’ll check compliance anyway — but ask.)

---

## **4️⃣ Geographic Scope**

1. Are we focusing strictly on Kilkenny?
    
2. Do you want nearby counties mentioned?
    
3. Do you actively want work outside Kilkenny, or just accept it if it comes?
    

  

(Default recommendation: Kilkenny-focused.)

---

## **5️⃣ Ads & Tracking**

1. Do you plan to run Google Ads or Facebook Ads?
    
2. If yes, roughly small test or serious lead channel?
    
3. Do you want analytics tracking installed from day one?
    

  

(No need for him to disclose exact budget.)

---

## **6️⃣ Growth Plan (Use the Data Here)**

  

You say:

  

“Based on the research:

- Property keywords are 100–1K searches/month with CPC up to €9.
    
- Probate cost searches are 100–1K/month with low competition.
    
- Family law is high volume but broader and more competitive.
    

  

If property is your strongest revenue stream, it makes sense to dominate that first.”

  

Then ask:

1. Should Probate/Wills be next priority?
    
2. Or do you want Family positioned equally?
    

---

## **7️⃣ Differentiation**

1. Why should someone choose you over another Kilkenny solicitor?
    
2. What are you genuinely strongest at? (speed, communication, clarity, problem-solving)
    
    
    

---

## **8️⃣ Business Conversation (Pricing Framing)**

  

Then you say:

  

> “There are two directions this can go. A basic brochure-style site, or a structured SEO-focused lead generation site. They’re priced differently.”

  

Then move into pricing.

---

# **💰 PRICING STRUCTURE (Based on Your Scope)**

  

You are NOT building a €1,200 site.

  

You are building:

- Multi-page legal site
    
- Custom structured copy
    
- Keyword research driven
    
- Conversion-first layout
    
- SEO architecture
    
- Compliance-aware copy
    
- Hosting setup
    
- Performance optimisation
    
- Analytics integration
    

  

That is professional work.

---

## **Option A – Basic Brochure Build**

  

€1,800 – €2,500

  

Includes:

- All pages built
    
- Clean layout
    
- Hosting on Vercel
    
- Legal pages
    
- Basic SEO structure
    
- No deep keyword strategy
    
- No conversion structuring
    

  

This is “online presence”.

---

## **Option B – Conversion & SEO Structured Legal Site**

  

€3,000 – €4,500

  

Includes:

- Structured service pages built around keyword research
    
- Conversion-focused layout
    
- FAQ structured for search
    
- Internal linking strategy
    
- Location targeting (Kilkenny focus)
    
- Trust positioning
    
- Tracking setup
    
- Performance optimisation
    
- Built as lead-generation asset
    

  

This is not a website.

This is a growth asset.

  

If property client fees are €1,500–€2,500+, one client pays for the site.

  

That’s why it costs more.

---

## **Ongoing (Optional)**

  

Maintenance:

€100–€200/month

  

SEO ongoing (if ever):

€300–€600/month

  

Ads management (if ever):

Separate pricing.

---

# **⚙️ Why Astro + Vercel (And Not WordPress/Webflow)**

  

You need to explain this clearly.

  

### **1️⃣ Performance**

  

Astro generates static pages.

- Extremely fast load times
    
- Better SEO performance
    
- Better Core Web Vitals
    

  

Google prefers fast sites.

---

### **2️⃣ Security**

  

No plugins.

No WordPress vulnerabilities.

No update cycles breaking the site.

  

Much lower security risk.

  

Very important for a solicitor.

---

### **3️⃣ Low Maintenance**

  

WordPress:

- Plugin updates
    
- Theme updates
    
- Security patches
    
- Backup management
    

  

Astro:

- Static output
    
- Minimal moving parts
    
- Extremely stable
    

---

### **4️⃣ Hosting Cost**

  

Vercel:

- Very cheap
    
- Globally fast
    
- Reliable
    

  

WordPress hosting often:

- Slower
    
- More maintenance overhead
    

---

### **5️⃣ Long-Term Scalability**

  

This structure allows:

- Easy new service pages
    
- SEO expansion
    
- Structured growth
    

  

Without rebuilding.

---

# **🎯 Now the Real Question**

  

You need to decide something:

  

Are you pricing like:

- A friend helping a friend
    
    or
    
- A specialist building a niche service business?
    

  

You can give a friend discount.

  

But don’t undervalue strategic work.

What number are you thinking of saying?

  

I’ll tell you whether it’s too low.
