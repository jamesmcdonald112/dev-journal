otopions to propmotes outseide kilkenny?

## **1️⃣ Scope Confirmation (Foundation)**

  

“Before we talk price, I just want to confirm scope so I price it properly.”

- We’re looking at:
    
    - Home
        
    - 4–8 service pages (Property first, then Probate, Family, etc.)
    - page for each service. 
        
    - About - about the firm, no individual pages.
        
    - Contact
        
    - Legal pages (Privacy, Cookies, Disclaimer, Terms, Accessibility, Complaints)
        
    

  

Questions:

1. Do you want all main services live at launch, or launch with Property first and phase the rest?
    
2. Do you expect regular content updates, or mostly static?
    
3. Will you want ongoing SEO work after launch, or just the initial structure?
    
4. Are ads something you see using this year, or not right now?
    

---

## **2️⃣ Positioning (Very Important)**

1. Do you want to be positioned mainly as property-focused, or as a full general practice?
    
2. Is residential property your biggest revenue area?
    
3. Do you want commercial conveyancing mentioned, or mostly residential?
    
4. Are you comfortable targeting “Property Solicitor Kilkenny” directly?
    
5. Within property, are buyers your biggest market, or sellers?
    
6. Who is your ideal client? (first-time buyers, couples upgrading, investors, developers?)
    

---

## **3️⃣ Trust & Compliance**

1. Can we mention years in practice? 46 years (maybe do dynamically using js or something)
    
2. Can we use testimonials? 
    
3. Can we embed Google reviews?
    
4. Are you comfortable with wording like “experienced property solicitors”? - yes
    
5. Are there any specific Law Society advertising rules you’re aware of that we need to follow?
    

  

(You’ll check compliance anyway — but ask.)

---

## **4️⃣ Geographic Scope**

1. Are we focusing strictly on Kilkenny? - yes
    
2. Do you want nearby counties mentioned? - thye work in othere areas so i have to figure out if they can find wording fo rit. best might be a small local firm.
    
3. Do you actively want work outside Kilkenny, or just accept it if it comes? - accept if it comes possibly
    

  

(Default recommendation: Kilkenny-focused.)

---

## **5️⃣ Ads & Tracking**

1. Do you plan to run Google Ads or Facebook Ads? - maybe later i told them it woudl be good to run google ads at the start ot boost the site, is that a good idea?
    
2. If yes, roughly small test or serious lead channel?
    
3. Do you want analytics tracking installed from day one?
    

  

(No need for him to disclose exact budget.)

---

## **6️⃣ Growth Plan (Use the Data Here)**

  

You say:

  

“Based on the research:

- Property keywords are 100–1K searches/month with CPC up to €9.
    
- Probate cost searches are 100–1K/month with low competition.
    
- Family law is high volume but broader and more competitive.
    

  

If property is your strongest revenue stream, it makes sense to dominate that first.”

  

Then ask:

1. Should Probate/Wills be next priority?
    
2. Or do you want Family positioned equally?
    

---

## **7️⃣ Differentiation**

1. Why should someone choose you over another Kilkenny solicitor?
    
2. What are you genuinely strongest at? (speed, communication, clarity, problem-solving)
	1. happy using words like that

	3. Expertise in that area
	4. Personal abilti, 
	5. communications
	6. clarity
	7. Staying informs and up to date iwth teh clients
	8. Friednly

## **8️⃣ Business Conversation (Pricing Framing)**

  

Then you say:

  

> “There are two directions this can go. A basic brochure-style site, or a structured SEO-focused lead generation site. They’re priced differently.”

  

Then move into pricing.

---

# **💰 PRICING STRUCTURE (Based on Your Scope)**

  

You are NOT building a €1,200 site.

  

You are building:

- Multi-page legal site
    
- Custom structured copy
    
- Keyword research driven
    
- Conversion-first layout
    
- SEO architecture
    
- Compliance-aware copy
    
- Hosting setup
    
- Performance optimisation
    
- Analytics integration
    

  

That is professional work.

---

## **Option A – Basic Brochure Build**

  

€1,800 – €2,500

  

Includes:

- All pages built
    
- Clean layout
    
- Hosting on Vercel
    
- Legal pages
    
- Basic SEO structure
    
- No deep keyword strategy
    
- No conversion structuring
    

  

This is “online presence”.

---

## **Option B – Conversion & SEO Structured Legal Site**

  

€3,000 – €4,500

  

Includes:

- Structured service pages built around keyword research
    
- Conversion-focused layout
    
- FAQ structured for search
    
- Internal linking strategy
    
- Location targeting (Kilkenny focus)
    
- Trust positioning
    
- Tracking setup
    
- Performance optimisation
    
- Built as lead-generation asset
    

  

This is not a website.

This is a growth asset.

  

If property client fees are €1,500–€2,500+, one client pays for the site.

  

That’s why it costs more.

---

## **Ongoing (Optional)**

  

Maintenance:

€100–€200/month

  

SEO ongoing (if ever):

€300–€600/month

  

Ads management (if ever):

Separate pricing.

# **⚖️ Astro vs WordPress vs Webflow**

  

_(For a Solicitor Website)_

---

# **1️⃣ Performance (Speed & SEO)**

  

### **🟢 Astro**

- Generates static HTML
    
- Extremely fast load times
    
- Excellent Core Web Vitals
    
- No runtime overhead
    

  

Best for SEO performance.

---

### **🟡 WordPress**

- Dynamic PHP
    
- Depends heavily on hosting
    
- Plugins slow it down
    
- Often bloated
    

  

Can be fast — but usually isn’t without optimisation.

---

### **🟡 Webflow**

- Good performance
    
- Hosted on their CDN
    
- Slightly heavier than Astro
    
- Still good SEO
    

  

Solid, but not as lean as Astro.

---

# **2️⃣ Security**

  

### **🟢 Astro**

- No database exposed
    
- No plugins
    
- No admin login to attack
    
- Static output = extremely secure
    

  

Very low risk.

---

### **🔴 WordPress**

- Biggest CMS in the world
    
- Target for hackers
    
- Plugin vulnerabilities
    
- Needs updates constantly
    

  

High maintenance risk.

---

### **🟡 Webflow**

- Hosted platform
    
- No plugin risk
    
- Secure infrastructure
    
- Limited backend control
    

  

Safe, but locked into platform.

---

# **3️⃣ Maintenance**

  

### **🟢 Astro**

- No updates needed
    
- No plugin conflicts
    
- No version breaks
    
- Hosting rarely causes issues
    

  

Very low ongoing maintenance.

---

### **🔴 WordPress**

- Theme updates
    
- Plugin updates
    
- PHP version updates
    
- Hosting management
    
- Security patches
    

  

Ongoing maintenance required.

---

### **🟡 Webflow**

- No plugin updates
    
- Platform handles hosting
    
- But you depend on Webflow ecosystem
    

  

Low maintenance, but not fully owned.

---

# **4️⃣ Flexibility & Control**

  

### **🟢 Astro**

- Full code control
    
- Custom SEO structure
    
- Full ownership
    
- Can migrate anywhere
    

  

Completely yours.

---

### **🟡 WordPress**

- Flexible
    
- But often plugin-dependent
    
- Harder to keep clean long-term
    

---

### **🔴 Webflow**

- Locked into Webflow
    
- Harder to export properly
    
- Ongoing subscription
    

  

You don’t truly own the platform.

---

# **5️⃣ Cost Structure**

  

### **Astro**

- Hosting: Very low (Vercel)
    
- No CMS subscription
    
- No plugin fees
    
- You control updates
    

---

### **WordPress**

- Hosting cost
    
- Premium theme cost
    
- Plugin costs
    
- Maintenance cost
    

---

### **Webflow**

- Monthly subscription
    
- CMS plan fees
    
- Hosting bundled
    
- Can get expensive long term
    

---

# **6️⃣ Best Fit for This Solicitor Project**

  

This project is:

- Local
    
- SEO-driven
    
- Lead generation focused
    
- Mostly static content
    
- High trust industry
    
- Needs security
    
- Doesn’t require blog-heavy publishing
    

  

Astro fits that perfectly.

---

# **🔥 Simple Explanation You Can Say**

  

> “I’m building this in Astro rather than WordPress or Webflow because it gives you better speed, better security, and lower long-term maintenance. It’s not plugin-based, so it won’t break over time, and you fully own it.”

  

That’s clean.

---

# **🎯 Honest Positioning**

  

If he wanted:

- Frequent blogging
    
- Internal editing himself
    
- Non-technical editing access
    

  

Then WordPress or Webflow might make more sense.

  

But that’s not this site.

  

This is:

- Structured service pages
    
- Stable content
    
- Growth-focused architecture
    

  

Astro is stronger long-term.
