# **2) How to use these (SEO + Ads) without guessing**

  

## **SEO (pages to build / focus)**

  

You said priority is **A) Property**, **B) Probate**.

  

### **Property page keyword mapping**

  

Create ONE strong page targeting plain English + optional conveyancing:

**/buying-and-selling-property** (or /property)

- Primary: **property solicitor kilkenny**, **buying a house solicitor**, **house purchase solicitor**, **selling a house solicitor**
    
- Secondary in headings/FAQ: **conveyancing solicitor**, **conveyancing costs**, **fixed fee conveyancing**, **solicitor costs for buying a house**
    
- Copy rule: use “Buying & selling property” wording, mention “(conveyancing)” once early.
    

  

### **Probate page keyword mapping**

  

**/wills-and-probate** (or /probate)

- Primary: **probate solicitor**, **wills solicitor**
    
- Secondary: **probate costs ireland**, **probate fees ireland**, **how much does probate cost**
    
- Add an FAQ block answering fees (without quoting numbers unless solicitor confirms).
    

  

### **Home page**

  

Home page targets broad:

- “Solicitor in Kilkenny” + your two priority services (Property + Probate) above the fold.
    

  

## **Google Ads (how to structure it)**

  

Make separate **campaigns/ad groups** so keywords don’t mix.

  

**Campaign 1: Property**

- Ad group: Property solicitor
    
    - property solicitor
        
    - house purchase solicitor
        
    - buying a house solicitor
        
    - selling a house solicitor
        
    - conveyancing solicitor
        
    
- Ad group: Property costs/fees
    
    - solicitor costs for buying a house
        
    - solicitor fee for buying a house
        
    - conveyancing costs
        
    - fixed fee conveyancing
        
    

  

**Campaign 2: Probate**

- probate solicitor
    
- wills solicitor
    
- probate costs ireland / probate fees ireland
    
- solicitors for wills near me (only if you’re happy taking broader intent)
    

  

**Location targeting for ads**

- If the practice only serves Kilkenny: target **Kilkenny County** (not “Ireland”).
    
- If they’ll take nearby counties: Kilkenny + Carlow + Waterford + Tipperary (tight radius).
    
- Don’t overthink now: start tighter, expand later.

# **3) What to exclude / negatives (important)**

  

You’re seeing lots of competitor names and UK-ish legal terms. Don’t let them waste budget.

  

## **Competitor brand negatives (ads)**

  

Add as **negative keywords** (phrase match is fine):

- smithwick
    
- harte
    
- hogan
    
- boland
    
- canny
    
- hughes walsh
    
- bass
    
- poe kiely hogan lanigan
    
- (and any other solicitor names you saw)
    

  

## **Likely UK/noise negatives (ads)**

- leasehold
    
- lease extension
    
- shared ownership
    
- right to buy
    
- housing disrepair
    
- no win no fee (only if they don’t do PI / no-win-no-fee)
    
- “northern ireland”
    
- “jersey”

# **5) What you should do next (in order)**

1. **Stop keyword planner for now.** You already have enough to build the two priority pages.
    
2. Do SERP reverse engineering for:
    
    - **property solicitor kilkenny**
        
    - **probate solicitor kilkenny**
        
    
3. From SERP, we decide:
    
    - page title format (what competitors do)
        
    - section headings that match intent
        
    - what “trust signals” they push (reviews, years, fixed-fee, fast turnaround, etc.)
        
    

  

If you paste the **top 5 organic results + the page titles** for the first query (“property solicitor kilkenny”), I’ll map the exact content structure you should ship for that page.
