Good. Now we analyse properly.

  

No emotion. Just structure and gaps.

# **🔎 HUGHES WALSH – PROPERTY PAGE**

  

You pasted:

  

> “Read: 7 Steps to Buying and Selling Property”

> “Speed Up Your Property Sale”

  

That tells us immediately:

  

### **They are using:**

- Process framing (“7 Steps”)
    
- Speed framing (“Speed up your sale”)
    
- Educational tone
    

  

They are NOT:

- Targeting exact-match keywords in headings
    
- Using strong local modifiers repeatedly
    
- Structuring for conversion
    

  

It’s educational-first.

Not conversion-first.

# **🔎 GRACE SOLICITORS – PROBATE PAGE**

  

Let’s dissect this.

  

### **Their H1:**

  

> WILLS & PROBATE

  

Very broad.

---

### **Their positioning angle:**

- Peace of mind
    
- One-to-one consultation
    
- Privacy
    
- Law Society compliance
    
- Emotional reassurance
    

  

They are selling:

- Trust
    
- Comfort
    
- Confidentiality
    

  

They are NOT selling:

- Speed
    
- Cost transparency
    
- Clear process
    
- Clear next steps
    

---

### **What’s missing?**

1. No strong Kilkenny repetition
    
2. No cost guidance
    
3. No timeline guidance
    
4. No FAQ structured for search intent
    
5. No strong call-to-action above the fold
    
6. No keyword-specific headers
    

  

It’s written like:

“We are nice solicitors.”

  

Not:

“If you need probate in Kilkenny, here is exactly how it works.”

---

# **🔥 STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY**

  

Right now in Kilkenny:

  

Nobody owns:

That means:

  

You can outrank with:

- Better keyword targeting
    
- Better structure
    
- Clear local signals
    
- Process clarity
    
- Cost transparency section
