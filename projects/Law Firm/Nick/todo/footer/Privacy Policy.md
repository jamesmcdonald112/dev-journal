Both the law firm and I make this together

**Best practice:**

- You provide a **template**
    
- They confirm or adjust content
    

  

Why:

- You know what the site collects
    
- They know how they handle enquiries
    

  

Process:

1. You draft based on:
    
    - Contact form
        
    - Email links
        
    - Analytics
        
    
2. They approve or tweak
    

  

This is standard and acceptable.
