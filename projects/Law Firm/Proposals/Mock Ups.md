Here’s the **practical, professional, low-effort way** to do mockups that SELL — without wasting time.

  

This is exactly how small agencies do it.

---

# **⭐** 

# **1. YES — you should have a reusable mockup template ready.**

  

You DO NOT design a fresh mockup for every client.

That’s a waste of time.

  

Instead:

  

### **You create** 

### **ONE**

###  **beautiful homepage mockup (Tailwind UI + your styling)**

  

→ Save it as a reusable “template.”

→ Swap the text & logo for each new prospect.

→ Screenshot it.

→ Insert into your audit PDF.

  

This is exactly how you do scalable outreach.

---

# **⭐** 

# **2. What the mockup should include (single-page only)**

  

Do **NOT** mock up an entire site.

Do **NOT** spend hours designing custom layouts.

  

You ONLY mock up the **homepage hero + top fold**:

  

### **Your mockup includes:**

- Header
    
- Hero section
    
- One service block or CTA
    
- Placeholder testimonial row (optional)
    

  

That’s it.

  

This takes **15–20 minutes** once your template exists.

# **⭐** 

# **3. The mockup DOES NOT need to match their branding exactly**

  

Solicitors _do not care_ about:

- exact colours
    
- exact fonts
    
- perfect matching imagery
    

  

They care about SEEING:

- speed
    
- modernity
    
- professionalism
    
- trust
    
- mobile responsiveness
    

  

Your mockup’s job is to **demonstrate the difference** between their old site and a modern rebuild — not to deliver final design.

# **4. The mockup process (step-by-step)**

  

### **Step 1 – Build your reusable mockup in Figma or direct HTML**

  

Two options:

  

#### **Option A: Figma**

- Create a homepage template
    
- Drop in Tailwind UI components
    
- Add generic placeholders
    
- Save it as your “pitch template”
    

  

#### **Option B: Build it directly with Astro/Tailwind**

- Create a real homepage layout in your starter repo
    
- Use placeholder text
    
- Deploy it to a hidden URL
    
- Screenshot parts of it for future clients
    

  

Either works.

---

### **Step 2 – For each potential client:**

1. Open your mockup template
    
2. Swap:
    
    - Business name
        
    - Logo (optional)
        
    - 2–3 service names
        
    - One tagline about their niche
        
    
3. Export as PNG
    

  

Time required: **5–10 minutes per client**.

---

### **Step 3 – Insert the screenshot into your audit**

  

Place it after your Lighthouse & SEO findings.

  

This is the conversion booster.

  

### **Text example:**

  

“Here’s a quick concept showing how your firm’s homepage could look with a modern layout. This is just a rough visual — the final design would use your branding and colours.”

# **⭐** 

# **5. Why only mock up the HERO / TOP-FOLD?**

  

Because:

- It’s the ONLY part clients judge
    
- It sets the tone
    
- It’s 90% of the “wow factor”
    
- It avoids doing unnecessary unpaid work
    
- It’s 100% enough to help them imagine the redesign
    

  

A full-page mockup = time-wasting for free.

A top-fold mockup = maximum impact for minimum effort.

# **⭐** 

# **6. What NOT to do**

  

❌ Do NOT build a full custom design per client

❌ Do NOT mock up multiple pages

❌ Do NOT spend hours on colours and typography

❌ Do NOT make it pixel-perfect

❌ Do NOT send a full demo site

❌ Do NOT do anything before they reply to your initial email

---

# **⭐** 

# **7. Should you host a live preview?**

  

ONLY if you want extra wow factor — but it’s not required.

  

Example:

- Use your base Astro template
    
- Swap text
    
- Deploy to yourdomain.com/demo/<clientname>
    
- Take snapshots from that live preview
    
- DO NOT share the URL unless they ask for more info
    

  

The goal is **speed**, not producing full demo sites.

---

# **⭐ Final Answer**

  

**Yes — create one reusable homepage mockup, reuse it for every prospect, swap their details, screenshot it, and include it after your audit.**

  

That’s all you need.

It’s fast, effective, and scalable.
