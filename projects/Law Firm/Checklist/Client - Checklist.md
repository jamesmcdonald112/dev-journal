Ask these **before** design.

- What is the **primary goal**?
    
    - Phone calls?
        
    - Contact form enquiries?
        
    - Both?
        
    
- Who is the **ideal client**?
    
    - Individuals / families / businesses?
        
    - Local Kilkenny only or wider?
        
    
- What type of work does he **want more of**?
    
    - (Not what he does occasionally — what he wants to attract)
        
    
- Any work he **does NOT want advertised**?
    

  

> Outcome: decide what gets priority on the homepage.

## **3. Practice Areas (critical)**

  

Go through this slowly.

  

For each area:

- Is this a **core service** or secondary?
    
- Does he want a **separate page** or just a section?
    
- Any areas that are **regulated / sensitive** (e.g. personal injury)?
    

  

Typical list to sanity-check:

- Conveyancing (Residential / Commercial)
    
- Probate / Wills
    
- Family Law
    
- Personal Injury
    
- Employment
    
- Litigation
    
- Business / Company Law
    
- Notary (if applicable)
    

  

> You will later turn this into /services/[slug].astro.

## **4. Competitor & Style Review (do this live)**

  

Sit together and open 5–10 solicitor sites.

  

For each site:

- What looks **professional**?
    
- What looks **dated or bad**?
    
- Layout preference:
    
    - Traditional / conservative
        
    - Clean / modern
        
    
- Content length:
    
    - Minimal
        
    - Detailed explanations
        
    

  

**Important:**

Most solicitors say “simple” but mean “traditional”. Call that out.

---

## **5. Pages to Decide (default set)**

  

Confirm yes/no on each:

- Home
    
- Services / Practice Areas
    
- About the Firm
    
- Solicitor Profile(s)
    
- Contact
    
- Thank You page (for enquiries)
    
- Privacy Policy (mandatory)
    

  

Optional:

- Locations (if more than Kilkenny)
    
- FAQs
    
- Testimonials (only if compliant + approved)
    

---

## **6. Content Ownership (be blunt here)**

  

Make this crystal clear.

  

### **What** 

### **he must provide**

- Firm name (exact legal name)
    
- Address
    
- Phone number
    
- Main enquiry email
    
- Solicitor names + qualifications
    
- Law Society registration details (if required)
    
- Any **existing wording** he wants reused
    
- Logo (if he has one)
    
- Photos (office / headshot) OR approval for stock
    

  

### **What** 

### **you will handle**

- Page structure
    
- Drafting _safe, conservative_ marketing copy
    
- Technical setup
    
- Forms, tracking, deployment
    

  

**You must say this explicitly:**

  

> “Final wording must be approved by you before publication.”

---

## **7. Compliance & Risk Check (Ireland-specific)**

  

Walk through this verbally.

- No:
    
    - “Best solicitor”
        
    - “Guaranteed outcomes”
        
    - Win rates
        
    
- Testimonials only if:
    
    - Real
        
    - Approved
        
    - Consent given
        
    
- Personal injury language must be cautious
    
- Privacy notice required
    
- Analytics disclosure required (even if minimal)
    

  

This protects **both of you**.

---

## **8. Enquiry Handling Flow (important)**

  

Decide exactly what happens when someone submits a form.

- Form fields:
    
    - Name
        
    - Phone
        
    - Email
        
    - Short message
        
    
- Where does it go?
    
    - His email
        
    - Your agency email (always)
        
    
- Response expectations:
    
    - Same day?
        
    - Next business day?
        
    

  

Explain:

- No database
    
- No login
    
- Email only
    
- Conversion tracked on /thanks
    

---

## **9. Domain & Hosting (clarify ownership)**

  

Ask directly:

- Does he already own a domain?
    
    - Yes → get registrar login later
        
    - No → decide name together
        
    
- Who pays for:
    
    - Domain
        
    - Hosting
        
    

  

**Best practice:**

Domain in **his name**, hosting under **your agency**.

---

## **10. Maintenance Expectations (set boundaries early)**

  

You must outline this even if informal.

- Text changes handled by you
    
- No self-editing
    
- Changes submitted via form/email
    
- Batched updates (not ad-hoc WhatsApps)
    

  

If you don’t set this now, it becomes chaos later.

---

## **11. Timeline & Next Steps (end the meeting with this)**

  

Before he leaves, agree on:

- What he will send you (list it)
    
- By when
    
- First draft delivery date
    
- One revision round included
    
- Final approval step
    

---

## **12. What YOU Should Have Ready Before He Arrives**

- This checklist (printed or noted)
    
- 2–3 **example solicitor sites** you like
    
- A rough **homepage wireframe in your head**
    
- Clear explanation of:
    
    - What you do
        
    - What you don’t do
        
    - How changes work
        
    

---

### **If you want next:**

  

I can give you:

- A **one-page client intake form** (copy-paste)
    
- A **“what I need from you” email**
    
- A **live meeting script** so you don’t miss anything
    

  

Say which one you want.
