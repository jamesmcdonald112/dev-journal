## **SECTION 2 — Practice Areas (critical, do this slowly)**

  

For **each** practice area, ask the same questions.

  

**Start by listing everything they do. Then refine.**

  

For each area:

1. Is this a **core service** or secondary?
    
2. Should it have:
    
    - Its own page?
        
    - Just a section on a main services page?
        
    
3. Who is it for?
    
    - Individuals / businesses
        
    
4. Any **regulatory sensitivity** here?
    
    - (Personal injury, family law, etc.)
        
    
5. Any wording they **definitely want included** or avoided?
    

  

Example prompt:

  

> “If a client landed on this page, what should they clearly understand by the end?”
