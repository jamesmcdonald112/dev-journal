Here is a **single, clean, merged note** that covers _everything_ clearly and logically — maintenance, hosting, domain setup, responsibilities, and why Astro eliminates 95% of traditional website maintenance.

  

You can give this directly to the client or keep it for your own reference.

# **Website Maintenance & Hosting Plan — Clear Summary**

  

This explains exactly what maintenance is needed for an Astro website, what is optional, how hosting should be set up, and why this approach avoids all the problems of WordPress.

---

# **1. What Maintenance Is Actually Needed for an Astro Site**

  

### **✅** 

### **Required (very minimal)**

  

These only happen when something changes in the business:

- Update business details (**if they change**)
    
- Small edits (**adding a new service, updating text**)
    
- Technical dependency updates (**every 3–6 months**) — automated via Dependabot
    

  

This is extremely low effort.

---

### **🟡** 

### **Optional (nice-to-have, professional extras)**

- Broken link checks
    
- Uptime monitoring
    
- SEO health checks
    
- Fixing external embeds if they ever break (Calendly, Google Maps)
    

  

You can choose to offer these **as paid add-ons** but they are _not required_ for the site to function.

---

### **❌** 

### **Not required at all (these are WordPress issues)**

- Monthly patching
    
- Security maintenance
    
- Plugin updates
    
- Server maintenance
    
- Fixing hacks
    

  

Astro does **not** have:

- a login page
    
- plugins
    
- PHP
    
- a database
    
- a 24/7 server to attack
    

  

So none of the WordPress-style problems apply.

  

**Astro reduces maintenance workload by ~95%.**

# **2. Hosting & Domain: Cleanest Setup**

  

### **✔ They already own the domain**

  

Good — **the domain stays in their name and account**.

  

### **✔ They create the hosting account (Vercel or Netlify)**

  

They should always own their hosting.

  

**Why?**

- They own their business assets
    
- You avoid billing responsibility
    
- Their site cannot go down if your card expires
    
- If you ever stop working together, they still control their site
    

  

This keeps boundaries clean.

---

# **3. Moving Their Existing Domain to the New Site**

  

You **do not move the domain** anywhere.

You simply **change DNS settings** to point the domain to Vercel or Netlify.

  

### **Steps:**

1. Log in to their domain registrar (GoDaddy, Blacknight, etc.)
    
2. Remove the old DNS records
    
3. Add the new DNS records from Vercel/Netlify
    
4. Wait for DNS to update (30 minutes – 24 hours)
    

  

**The domain stays with them.**

**The website now lives on modern hosting.**

---

# **4. Giving You Access Without Giving You Ownership**

  

They do NOT give you their password.

  

Two safe options:

---

### **Option A — Add you as a collaborator**

###  **(best option)**

  

They invite you into Vercel or Netlify:

- You can deploy updates
    
- You can manage environment variables
    
- They keep ownership and control
    

---

### **Option B — You deploy through GitHub**

  

Flow:

1. You create the GitHub repo
    
2. They connect it to Vercel/Netlify once
    
3. Every time you push, the site deploys
    

  

They never need to log into hosting again.

  

This is how agencies work.

---

# **5. Why You Should NOT Host It on Your Account**

- If something breaks → _you get blamed_
    
- If your card has an issue → _their site goes down_
    
- If you fall out → _they lose access_
    
- Mixing your business assets with their livelihood is risky
    

  

Always let the client own the infrastructure.

---

# **6. Recommended Maintenance Plan for a Friend**

  

Since they want **no monthly fee**, this is the cleanest approach:

  

### **✔ One-time build fee for the new site**

  

(€1,200–€1,500)

  

### **✔ €0/month ongoing charges**

  

They pay nothing monthly.

  

### **✔ They manage their Google Business Profile**

  

(This removes 90% of Local SEO upkeep)

  

### **✔ You offer:**

  

> “1–2 small updates per year for free.

> Anything bigger: €40/hour.”

  

### **✔ Domain billing stays with them**

  

### **✔ Hosting billing stays with them**

  

(Vercel/Netlify free tier is enough)

  

This keeps expectations clear and avoids unlimited free labour.

---

# **7. If They Ever Want Professional Maintenance**

  

You can offer optional (€30–€50/month):

- Minor edits
    
- Form tests
    
- Dependency updates
    
- SEO check-ins
    
- Quick fixes
    
- Monitoring uptime
    

  

But this is **optional**, not required.

---

# **⭐ Final Summary**

  

**Astro = ultra-low maintenance.**

No plugins, no hacks, no patching, no security problems.

  

**Client owns domain + hosting.**

You deploy through GitHub or as a collaborator.

  

**You only update the site when needed.**

No ongoing monthly obligations unless they choose it.

  

**They manage Google Business Profile.**

This removes almost all SEO maintenance.

  

This is the cleanest, safest, most professional system for both sides.
