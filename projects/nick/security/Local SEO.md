# **What Advanced Local SEO Actually Is**

  

Advanced Local SEO = all the things you do _outside the website and alongside it_ to tell Google:

  

> “This solicitor is a trusted, legitimate local business serving people in this specific area.”

  

Local SEO is different from normal SEO because Google wants to return **local professionals**, not random national websites.

  

Solicitors rely heavily on:

- “solicitor near me”
    
- “conveyancing solicitor Kilkenny”
    
- “probate solicitor Carlow”
    
- “family law solicitor Waterford”
    

  

Local SEO helps them appear in:

- Google Maps
    
- The top 3 listings (“Local Pack”)
    
- Search results for local services
    

  

This is extremely valuable, because people who search this are **ready to hire**.

# **The 4 Core Parts of Advanced Local SEO — Full Breakdown**

---

## **1. Google Business Profile Optimisation (GBP)**

  

This is the **most important part** of Local SEO — more important than the website.

  

Google uses GBP to determine:

- Are you a real business?
    
- Where are you located?
    
- What services do you offer?
    
- Do people review you?
    
- Are your details consistent?
    

  

### **What you must do:**

1. Choose the correct business category
    
    Example: **Solicitor**, **Legal Services**, **Law Firm** (you test which works best)
    
2. Add accurate NAP
    
    - Name
        
    - Address
        
    - Phone number
        
        Must match **exactly** everywhere else online.
        
    
3. Opening hours
    
4. Business description
    
5. Add photos (office, staff, logo)
    
6. Add services list (Conveyancing, Probate, Wills, Litigation, etc.)
    
7. Add service areas (Kilkenny, Carlow, etc.)
    
8. Get reviews over time (not all at once)
    

  

### **Why it matters:**

  

Google trusts businesses that have:

- Correct categories
    
- Consistent address info
    
- Regular updates
    
- Good photos
    
- Reviews
    

  

GBP ranking affects how high they appear in Maps and “solicitors near me.”

---

## **2. Local Citations (Directory Listings)**

  

A “citation” = their business name, address, phone number listed consistently on other websites.

  

Example places:

- GoldenPages
    
- Yelp
    
- Cylex
    
- Local law directories
    
- Irish business directories
    
- Chambers of Commerce
    
- Solicitor association listings
    

  

### **Why citations matter:**

  

Google checks whether the info about the business is **consistent** across the web.

  

If name, address, or phone differ, Google gets confused and ranks the site lower.

  

### **Your job:**

- Submit accurate NAP to 10–25 directories
    
- Ensure consistency in spelling (“Street” vs “St”, “&” vs “and”)
    

  

### **Difficulty:**

  

Easy but time-consuming. Mostly copy/paste.

---

## **3. Local Schema Markup (JSON-LD)**

  

This is code you add to the website that tells Google exactly what type of business it is.

  

Example:

```
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LegalService",
  "name": "McDonald Solicitors",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 High Street",
    "addressLocality": "Kilkenny",
    "addressCountry": "Ireland"
  },
  "telephone": "+353-123-4567",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

### **Why it matters:**

- It helps Google index the business faster
    
- It clarifies “this is a solicitor” — not a random blog
    
- Increases chances of rich results (stars, business details)
    
- Strengthens local relevance
    

  

### **Difficulty:**

  

Very easy.

  

You can even automate it in Astro using a config file so you update it once.

---

## **4. Local Keyword Optimisation**

  

This is simple: **you mention your services and your location on the website in the right places.**

  

### **Where:**

- Page titles
    
    Example: “Conveyancing Solicitor in Kilkenny”
    
- H1 headings
    
- Meta descriptions
    
- Body text
    
- Alt text for images
    
- URL structure
    

  

### **Example keywords:**

- “solicitor Kilkenny”
    
- “conveyancing solicitor Ireland”
    
- “probate solicitor Waterford”
    
- “family law solicitor Carlow”
    

  

### **Why it matters:**

  

Google matches:

- **User search term**
    
- **Location**
    
- **Service**
    
    to the pages that best fit all three.
    

  

### **Difficulty:**

  

Very easy. Mostly writing good titles.

# **What This Is Worth**

  

Freelancers typically charge:

  

**€200–€400 for Advanced Local SEO setup**

(One-time fee)

  

Agencies charge €500–€1,500.

  

You can realistically charge:

  

**€250–€350**

and deliver strong value.

---

# **How long it takes**

- GBP optimisation: 1 hour
    
- Citations: 1–3 hours
    
- Schema setup: 10 minutes
    
- Keyword optimisation: 30 minutes
    

---

# **How important is this for a solicitor?**

  

Very.

  

People rarely search for:

- “best solicitor blog post”
    

  

They search:

- “solicitor near me”
    
- “property solicitor Kilkenny”
    

  

Local SEO gets them seen in these results.

  

Without it, they appear much lower in Google Maps and local search.

---

# **Can any of this be automated?**

  

Some parts: **yes**

Some parts: **no**

  

### **You CAN automate:**

- Schema pulled from a single config file in Astro
    
- Meta tags auto-generated based on page data
    
- Sitemap auto-generation
    
- Consistency of NAP across your site
    

  

### **You CANNOT automate:**

- Updating external directory listings
    
- Google Business Profile changes
    
- Getting reviews
    
- Responding to GBP questions
    
- Monitoring local rankings
    

  

Local SEO requires occasional manual updates.

---

# **Does it require ongoing maintenance?**

  

A light amount — not heavy.

  

### **Occasional maintenance includes:**

- If the business moves location
    
- If phone number changes
    
- If new services are added
    
- Checking for duplicate or incorrect listings online
    
- Updating GBP photos every few months
    
- Responding to new GBP reviews
    

  

This is usually **part of a €30–€70/month maintenance plan**, but you can keep it minimal.

---

# **Summarised in one line**

  

Advanced Local SEO tells Google:

  

> “We are a real solicitor serving this specific area — send us local clients.”

### **Regular GBP updates include:**

- Adding new photos every so often
    
- Posting an update (optional)
    
- Updating special holiday hours (Google loves this)
    
- Responding to reviews
    
- Answering questions posted by the public
    
- Ensuring info stays accurate
    

  

Why?

Google rewards businesses that **appear active and alive**.

  

A GBP that has:

- no new photos for 3 years
    
- no reviews
    
- no responses
    
- no questions answered
    

  

…looks abandoned.

  

Google always ranks **active** local businesses higher.



# **✅** 

# **3. Local Schema Markup (JSON-LD)**

#  **— More detail**

  

### **What it is**

  

A small block of structured data that tells Google exactly what the business is.

  

### **Where it goes**

  

Inside the <head> section of your website.

  

In Astro this is trivial — you can place it in:

src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro

or

src/pages/index.astro

  

Example:
<head>
  ...
  <script type="application/ld+json">
    {JSON.stringify(schemaData)}
  </script>
</head>

### **Is it automatically generated?**

  

You can set it up to be **semi-automatic**.

  

For example:

- Create a business.json file with all the details.
    
- Import it into the layout.
    
- Generate JSON-LD dynamically.
    

  

So if the address or phone number changes, you only update **one single file**.

  

### **Does Google require it?**

  

No.

But it **helps Google understand exactly what the site is**.

  

For solicitors, the correct schema type is:

  

@type: "LegalService"

  

It improves ranking clarity.
