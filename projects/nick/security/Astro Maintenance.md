### **Ongoing maintenance needed for Astro?**

  

**Almost none.**

At most:

- Occasional dependency updates (every few months)
    
- Checking forms still submit properly
    
- Updating business info if it changes
    

  

This is _very low_ maintenance compared to WordPress.


# Astro Security Problems  problems?

  

If you use **Astro + a safe third-party form handler (Resend, Netlify Forms, Formspree) + Calendly**, then:

  

### **✔ You avoid** 

### **all**

###  **the WordPress-style hacks**

  

Because:

- No admin panel
    
- No plugins
    
- No PHP
    
- No database
    
- No login system
    

  

There is nothing for attackers to take over.

  

### **The only things you must avoid:**

  

**(And these are under your control as the developer)**

  

#### **• Misconfigured form endpoint**

If you accidentally expose your API endpoint publicly, someone could spam it.

Easy fix: rate-limit or use a trusted service.

  

#### **• Insecure third-party embed**

If you embed a shady script (you won’t).

Calendly is safe.

  

#### **• Bad hosting configuration**

If you store secrets in the client code.

Avoid by using environment variables.

  

#### **• Exposed API keys**

If you upload a secret to GitHub accidentally.

Don’t do that.







# **So do they actually need you for maintenance?**

  

### **If it’s Astro:**

  

**Website maintenance is minimal.**

  

Realistically:

- Maybe update business info once per year
    
- Maybe fix a small thing rarely
    
- Maybe update dependencies every 6–12 months
    

  

That’s it.

  

### **If THEY manage their GBP:**

  

They do:

- photos
    
- review replies
    
- questions
    
- profile changes
    

  

Then they don’t need you monthly.

  

### **If THEY DON’T want to manage GBP:**

  

You can offer:

  

**€30–€70/month**

for:

- replying to reviews
    
- adding photos
    
- keeping citations updated
    
- checking SEO health
    
- dealing with GBP issues
    

  

This is OPTIONAL.

You’re offering it as a convenience **only if they want to outsource it**.

  

### **Honest summary:**

  

If they want to do nothing themselves → offer maintenance.

If they’re happy to update GBP themselves → they only need you occasionally.


# **Clean message you can say to the client**

  

> “The website itself won’t need much maintenance because it’s static and secure. The only thing Google looks for activity on is your Google Business Profile — updates like photos, reviews, and answering questions. You can do all that yourself easily.

>   

> If you prefer me to handle that and keep your local SEO strong, I can do it for €30–€70/month. If not, you’ll only need occasional updates once or twice a year.”
