### **To-do list (do in this order, one item at a time)**

  

2. **Fix CTA links (remove placeholders)**
    

  

- Replace mailto:info@example.com with firm.email (or the real email).
    
- Set “Book consultation” to the real action (e.g., /#contact or /contact).
    

  

3. **Rewrite the HERO subtitle (conversion + exact keywords)**
    

  

- Make it 1–2 short sentences.
    
- Must include **exactly once**: “property solicitor Kilkenny”
    
- Must include **one** of: “buying a house solicitor” / “house purchase solicitor” / “selling a house solicitor”
    
- Mention **conveyancing** only once (parentheses ok).
    

  

4. **Add an in-page jump nav (top or sticky)**
    

  

- Add links: #buying, #selling, #process, #checklist, #faq, #contact
    
- Decide where it sits (below hero is fine).
    
- Add config field (optional) or hardcode—your choice.
    

  

5. **Add anchor IDs to the page sections**
    

  

- Buying section wrapper: id="buying"
    
- Selling: id="selling"
    
- Process: id="process"
    
- Checklist/prepare: id="checklist"
    
- FAQ: id="faq"
    
- Contact block: id="contact"
    

  

6. **Add a “Contact” block at the bottom of THIS page**
    

  

- Phone (tel link), email, address, opening hours.
    
- This is to satisfy #contact so users don’t have to leave the page.
    

  

7. **Add a final CTA strip above the footer**
    

  

- Short title + 1 line.
    
- Buttons: Call + Email/Book.
    
- This is your “close”.
    

  

8. **Tighten Buying + Selling summaries (keyword placement)**
    

  

- Buying summary includes “buying a house solicitor” or “house purchase solicitor” (once).
    
- Selling summary includes “selling a house solicitor” (once).
    
- No keyword stuffing elsewhere.
    

  

9. **Upgrade the FAQ answers (where fee keywords live)**
    

  

- Only inside FAQ include:
    
    - “solicitor costs for buying a house”
        
    - “conveyancing costs”
        
    - “fixed fee conveyancing”
        
    
- No numbers. Keep answers short and practical.
    

  

10. **Remove/replace non-ideal imagery**
    

  

- Replace lady-justice3.webp on this page with a property-relevant image (we’ll pick specifics next).
    
- Ensure alt text matches the actual image.
