# Setting Up Obsidian for Technical Note-Taking


## What I Learned

How to structure Obsidian for efficient note-taking and portfolio use. I set up templates, metadata, and plugins that keep learning notes and case studies consistent, connected, and easy to export later.

## Example / Code Snippet

Enabled and configured key plugins:

- Templater (custom templates, dynamic fields, folder rules)
- Dataview (query notes by folder, tag, or field)
- Advanced Tables (clean table editing)
- Outline, Tags, Properties, Outgoing Links (core navigation features)

## Why It Matters

Keeping notes structured, automated, and linked improves consistency, readability, and reuse. This setup lets me turn learning notes and case studies into website-ready content, complete with metadata, tags, and visual relationships.
