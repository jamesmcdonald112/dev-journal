# Virtual Machines (VMs)

## What I Learned
A VM is a software-defined computer running an OS and apps on shared physical hardware via a hypervisor.

## Key Questions

- How does a VM differ from a physical server?
- Why is virtualisation important for cloud computing?
- What resources are virtualised (CPU, memory, disk, network)?
- How do VMs achieve isolation and portability?

## Apply It
- Compare running your app on a local VM (VirtualBox) vs EC2.
- Visualise host → hypervisor → guest OS architecture.
