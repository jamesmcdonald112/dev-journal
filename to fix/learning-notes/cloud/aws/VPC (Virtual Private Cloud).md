# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

## What I Learned
A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where you control IP ranges, subnets, routing, and gateways.

## Key Questions
- What’s the difference between public and private subnets?
- How does routing work inside a VPC?
- How do Internet and NAT Gateways differ?
- How does a VPC provide isolation between clients?
## **Apply It**
- Create a small VPC with public/private subnets and one EC2 instance.
- SSH into the instance only through the public subnet.
