## What I Learned
Elastic Compute Cloud provides on-demand virtual servers (instances) to run applications in AWS. You choose the OS, instance type, and scale capacity as needed.

## Key Questions
- What does “elastic” mean in EC2?
- How does a hypervisor isolate EC2 instances?
- What’s the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?
- How does an AMI define an instance’s configuration?
- What’s the relationship between EC2, VPC, and Security Groups?
- When should I use On-Demand vs Reserved vs Spot instances?

## **Apply It**
- Deploy a simple API or website on an EC2 Free-Tier instance.
- SSH into it and install dependencies manually.
- Monitor CPU and memory with CloudWatch.
