# The Simple Guitar Practice Framework
## A Clear Way to Improve With Limited Time


> “It’s not the hours you put in, but what you put into the hours.”

Learning guitar as an adult doesn’t require extreme discipline.

It requires structure.

This simple framework gives you a repeatable way to practise — even if you only have short windows of time.

# The Three-Stage Practice Cycle

You repeat this cycle each week.

1. Setup  
2. Precision (including rhythm checks)  
3. Build & Integrate

## Stage 1 — Setup

Before you play a single note.

- Guitar easily accessible (out of the case or on a stand)
- Music notes available
- Lesson notes nearby
- Chair ready
- No setup friction

### Keep a Practice Notebook

After every session, write:

- Where you struggled  
- What improved  
- Questions for your teacher  
- How you solved something  

Start your next session there.

Bring those notes to your lesson.

You’ll make far better use of your time.

> Starting should take seconds, not minutes.

## Stage 2 — Precision (and Rhythm Checks)

This is where real progress happens.

### The Three Clean Rule

For anything:

- One bar  
- One rhythm  
- One chord change  

Do three clean repetitions in a row.

If you make a mistake, restart the count.

Once you complete three:
- Move forward  
- Combine gradually  

> Accuracy before expansion.

---

### Break It Smaller Than You Think

If the first two notes are wrong:
Fix the first two notes.

If one bar feels difficult:
Work on half a bar.

If half a bar feels difficult:
Work on two notes.

Smaller sections create stronger foundations.

> Smaller work builds lasting control.

---

### Clap Before You Play

Most mistakes begin with unclear rhythm.

- Clap the rhythm  
- Count out loud  
- Clap three clean repetitions  
- Then play while counting  

If rhythm feels uncertain, isolate it before playing.

> Rhythm clarity prevents future frustration.

---

### Slow Builds Progress

If it doesn’t work slowly, it isn’t learned yet.

Start around 50 to 60 BPM.

Increase only when:

- Clean  
- Relaxed  
- No hesitation  

Example progression:

60 BPM  
68 BPM  
76 BPM  
84 BPM  
92 BPM  

Learn fast, forget fast.  
Learn slowly, forget slowly.

> Control creates durability.

## Stage 3 — Build & Integrate

Now you expand.

- Combine bars into phrases (four to eight bars)
- Apply Stage 2 again (three clean repetitions)
- Confirm rhythm if unsure (clap first if needed)
- Increase tempo gradually
- Record short clips
- Play along with recordings as often as possible

Playing with recordings improves:

- Timing  
- Consistency  
- Musical feel  
- Confidence  

Then repeat the cycle.

Setup → Precision → Build.

Each week.

> Build in layers, not leaps.

# How Often Should You Practise?

Frequent practice is more effective than one long session per week.

A strong rhythm:

- Three to five days per week  

Ideal:

- Around 30 minutes, five days a week  

If that’s not realistic:

Work with the time you have.

Two minutes is valid.  
Five minutes is valid.  
Short sessions done consistently outperform long sessions done rarely.

> Frequency beats intensity.

---

# The Plateau Principle

Progress does not feel dramatic.

You may experience:

- Slow weeks  
- Frustration  
- Doubt  

This is normal.

When you expect difficulty, it becomes easier to handle.

> Improvement is often quiet before it becomes obvious.

# Structured Learning

Many adult learners benefit from structured pathways such as:

- [RSL Awards](https://www.rslawards.com/)
- [Trinity College London](https://www.trinitycollege.com/qualifications/music)

These provide:

- Clear progression  
- Predictable scaling  
- Structured repertoire  
- Measurable benchmarks  

Even without exams, structure accelerates learning.

> Structure reduces guesswork.

---

# Practice vs Playing

Practice is:

- Slow  
- Isolated  
- Focused  
- Problem-solving  

Playing is:

- Continuous  
- Expressive  
- Enjoyable  

Both matter.

Improvement happens during deliberate practice.

> Progress happens where attention is highest.
