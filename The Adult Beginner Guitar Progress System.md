# The 15 Principles of Real Progress

---

## 1 — Remove Practice Barriers

- Guitar out of the case  
- Notes visible  
- Music open  
- Chair ready  
- No decisions required  

> Starting must feel automatic.

---

## 2 — Something Is Infinitely Better Than Nothing

Two minutes today is better than zero minutes for three days.

Consistency compounds.

> Momentum beats intensity.

---

## 3 — Break It Smaller Than You Think

Fix two notes before fixing a full bar.

If one bar is too much:
- Practice half a bar  

If half a bar is too much:
- Practice two notes  

> Precision before expansion.

---

## 4 — The Three Perfect Repetitions Rule

- One bar  
- Three clean repetitions  
- Move forward  
- Combine gradually  

> Reduce error before increasing speed.

---

## 5 — Clap Before You Play

1. Clap the rhythm  
2. Count out loud  
3. Clap three clean repetitions  
4. Then play while counting  

> Rhythm clarity first.

---

## 6 — Slow Is Professional

If it does not work slow, it will not work fast.

Start around 50 to 60 BPM.

> Control creates confidence.

---

## 7 — Speed Comes Last

Only increase tempo when:

- Notes are clean  
- Movements are relaxed  
- No hesitation  

Gradual increases:

- 60 BPM  
- 68 BPM  
- 76 BPM  
- 84 BPM  
- 92 BPM  

> Speed is earned, not forced.

---

## 8 — Progress Feels Invisible

Track:

- Tempo increases  
- Cleaner transitions  
- Reduced tension  
- Short recordings  

> Trust evidence, not emotion.

---

## 9 — Use Structured Systems

Recognised pathways such as:

- RSL Awards  
- Trinity College London  

Provide:

- Steady progression  
- Clear benchmarks  
- Predictable difficulty  

> Structure reduces guesswork.

---

## 10 — Work With a Teacher You Trust

Progress improves when:

- You trust feedback  
- You follow one consistent method  
- You avoid switching systems  

> Consistency compounds skill.

---

## 11 — Expect Frustration

Plateaus are normal.  
Doubt is normal.

Breakthrough follows discomfort.

> Frustration is part of the process.

---

## 12 — Schedule Practice Like a Meeting

If possible:
- Block weekly time  

If not:
- Use two to five minute blocks  

> Show up, even briefly.

---

## 13 — Rotate Focus Areas

Avoid mental fatigue.

Rotate:

- Technique  
- Rhythm  
- Repertoire  
- Expression  

> Variety maintains clarity.

---

## 14 — Record Yourself Often

Short recordings reveal:

- Timing issues  
- Tone inconsistencies  
- Hidden improvement  

> Feedback accelerates growth.

---

## 15 — Practice vs Playing

Practice is:
- Slow  
- Isolated  
- Problem solving  

Playing is:
- Continuous  
- Expressive  
- Enjoyable  

You need both.

> Improvement requires deliberate focus.

---

# Final Thought

Real progress comes from:

- Structure  
- Patience  
- Deliberate repetition  

> Adults who follow a system improve steadily.
