- Feature → Layout → polish
	- Features decide layout. Layout reveals hierarchy. Details come last.
- Design in grayscale
	- Use grayscale so contrast, size, and spacing do the real design work. Color and visual polish come last and should only enhance a design that already works. Mockups are disposable — iterate quickly, discard ideas, and rebuild as needed.
- Design and build the smallest useful version first. 
	- Assume everything is hard. Don’t design what you can’t ship. Design and build minimla versions only.
- Website personality is not abstract — it comes from concrete choices.
	- Typography → the strongest signal
	- Color → supports the tone
	- Border radius → subtle but powerful (more curved = more playful)
	- Language / copy → often more important than visuals
